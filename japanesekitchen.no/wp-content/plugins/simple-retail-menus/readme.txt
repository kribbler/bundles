Note: Default options do not need to be included in the shortcode. The only required attribute in the shortcode for a menu to display is 'name'.

'class' refers to the containing DIV that is generated for every menu.

	Options for 'class':
	- Three class styles are built into Simple Retail Menus: 'default', 'light', and 'dark'. 
	- If you create your own custom class for your menus you can enter it under the 'custom' option.
	  Note that the custom class text field will only allow you to enter valid CSS 	class names.
	  See 'display.css' for css style structure.
	
'header' refers to the name of your menu. It can be displayed in any html containing element.

	Options for 'header':
	- Any html container: div, span, p, h1-h6, section, article, etc.
	- 'none' will cause the menu title to not display.
	-  Default: 'h2'.

'desc' refers to the description of your menu. It can be displayed in any html containing element.

	Options  for 'desc':
	- Any html container: div, span, p, h2-h6, section, article, etc.
	- 'none' will cause the menu description to not display.
	-  Default: 'p'
	
'display' refers to the html structure the menu data is displayed in. YOu can choose to display any menu as rows in a table, Ordered list, unordered list, definition list or as a series of nested divs.

	Options  for 'display':
	- 'table'
	- 'ul'
	- 'ol'

'valcols' refers to the number of value columns to display. By default two columns will display. If you want only one to display you can set valcols="1".

= Advanced/Hacks =

Menu HTML Rendering: Menu data output is handled by 'includes/display.php'. Edit this file to achieve your own custom menu display.

Menu CSS Styling: Menu data CSS styles are defined in 'css/display.css'. You can edit this file to achieve your own custom menu display, however the preferred way to customize menu styling is to define a custom style in your theme style sheet and include that custom style in the short code.
