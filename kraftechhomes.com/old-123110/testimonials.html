  <p>“Even though we've built two homes previously, our Kraftech home was our first custom home.  We were admittedly apprehensive at what some people feel could be a daunting undertaking.  Our experience with Paul and Kraftech Homes was far from it!  Paul guided us through the planning, selection and building process with the highest level of care and professionalism.  His process is very organized  allowing the customer the ability to move through the process with much confidence and little stress.  Paul is a master at his craft and is truly a good person.  We feel anyone who doesn’t give Paul a chance to earn their business is missing out on an exciting process that leads to a premier product.”</p>

  <p>&quot;Paul made the entire building process very easy and  enjoyable. It was a great experience and we actually had fun doing it. Paul was  always available to answer questions and address concerns and made us feel  comfortable when doing so. What impressed us the most was that he was  meticulous and creative while taking into account our needs and wants. We can  honestly say, that the final product was 100% the way we envisioned it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Paul made the building process easy for us by going to  his office for everything including designing our home, offering options and  informing us of progress along the way. Paul was very timely in returning calls  and he made sure that the quality of our home was as good if not better than if  it were for his own home. We have recommended Kraftech to many people to build  their dream home. &quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Paul Karnow has assembled a great team of skilled and  efficient contractors that together turn out a consistent and quality product.  Paul customized our home to our design requirements and budget. His  organizational skills and scheduling are outstanding, resulting in a house  built to specifications and on time. The post delivery and attention during the  warranty period have been exceptional. We highly recommend Kraftech. &quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;We interviewed several builders and made our decision  to go with Kraftech based on the personalized design and attention to detail  that we saw in our custom designed home plan, and other Kraftech homes.  Throughout the building process we were kept  informed of the schedule and progress on our house, and we did move in on  time.  We are thrilled with the quality  of our home and love the added space and beautiful views we now have.   We are very happy with our home and would  definitely recommend Kraftech!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;We found the advantage of building our home with Paul  is that he does it all.&nbsp; He’s an artistic designer, a creative architect  and a trustworthy builder.&nbsp; We were new in the area.&nbsp; Paul gave us  his undivided attention and treated us as if we were his only customer.&nbsp;  He worked hard to accommodate all our requests including a quick turnaround in  only four months.&nbsp; Paul patiently guided us in our selections and design  decisions.&nbsp; He has a multitude of ideas to share and is willing to listen  and advise.&nbsp; Paul selects land with wonderful, private views and then  envisions how to build a home to take advantage of the beautiful setting.&nbsp;  Paul follows through and he follows up, any time, any place.&nbsp; He is not  just our builder, he is our friend.&nbsp; We love our home.&quot;</p>
