* Fixed: On Email and Cart product page meta, the select Button or Hyperlink text check box was not showing as active when selected and the post updated. The Hyperlink text was working on the front end, but just not showing as the activated selection on the meta. Causing some confusion - thanks to Craig Paterson for reporting it.

WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.* Fixed: Did a full WP_DEBUG. All uncaught exceptions, notices, warnings and errors fixed.

= 1.0.5 - 2013/04/10 =
* Fixed: WooCommerce Reviews form opening in duplicate popup tools, PrettyPhoto and Fancybox caused by our old WooCommerce v1.6 fancybox lib.
* Feature: Replaced dated Lightbox pop-up script with new ColorBox script.
* Fixed: Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing a -1 to show when email pop-up form is called. wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https: but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly.

= 1.0.1 - 2012/12/01 =
* Feature: Added option to Select 'Lightbox' popup tool for Email Inquiry button popup. Fancybox is the default WooCommerce popup tool but some bespoke theme use 'lightbox' which causes a conflict with both scripts trying to work on a single product page.
