<p>An expose of how many collection agencies act illegally when chasing debts and brining them to court. Beat The Debt Collector Ez Forms explains that if you challenge in the right way there is a high likelihood of winning, and ending up free of the debt. In reality collection agencies often do not have the legal right to chase debts, because they do not send a copy of the original contract with the court documents. This is just one reason, however. Beat The Debt Collector Ez Forms explains every possible strategy you can use to make the debt void.</p>

<p>Processing a debt claim is all about paperwork, and oft times they are not properly presented, with information missing or wrong. To check all this without the help of Beat The Debt Collector Ez Forms would take many days and hours of work, even if you knew what to look for. This is why people with debt problems traditionally have to seek expensive legal help, which just makes the situation worse. Lawyers are just running a business, and will take your money even if the service they offer is one you don't really need. Beat The Debt Collector Ez Forms now provides another way to fight off the debt collectors. It show exactly what you need to do to challenge any court proceedings. In the majority of cases if you show that you are prepared to challenge then the collectors will often move to dismiss the case themselves because they know that what they are doing is illegal.</p>

<p>The system is very easy to use. Beat The Debt Collector Ez Forms just supplies all the forms that you need to submit, how to fill them out, and when to present them. It is as easy as that. They challenge every aspect of the plaintiff's case and forces them to provide legal proof of their right to proceed with the case and proof that all the documents they submit are true and legal. Often this is not the case, because they expect most people not to put up any fight at all, in effect they win by default. It is strange that they can win so many cases on false evidence, but it is true. The reason is that the court will simply accept the evidence unless it is challenged. If you make a challenge, this changes everything. It is likely that he plaintiff will be unable to rebuff your challenge and will simply dismiss the case to save themselves any further costs.</p>
