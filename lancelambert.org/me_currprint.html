There has been no let up in that quickness. Since January in my last update, there has been an Israeli election with Bibi Netanyahu incepted as prime minister, the unsuccessful war in Gaza, the continuing economic and worldwide woes and problems and Durban II held at Geneva. I would like to read some scriptures. <br />
<br />First of all, in </em></font><em><font face="Georgia"><font size="3"><strong>Jeremiah 25:30-32: <br />
<br />&quot;Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, the LORD will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, saith the LORD. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.&quot; <br />
<br /></strong>I would like to add to that in the </font></font></em><em><font face="Georgia"><font size="3"><strong>Hebrew letter, chapter 12:26-29: <br />
<br />&quot;Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven. And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain. Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe: for our God is a consuming fire.&quot; <br />
<br /></strong>Then also in the same New Covenant, in </font></font></em><em><font face="Georgia"><font size="3"><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:1-12 (ASV): <br />
<br />&quot;Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him; to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand; let no man beguile you in any wise: for it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God. Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming; even he, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie: that all might be judged who believed not in the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. &quot; <br />
</strong><br />
In this update, I will seek to cover what has been dubbed &quot;Durban II,&quot; the United Nations conference in Geneva on racism, the continuing world recession and its possible consequences, the Israeli election and its consequence and effect. <br />
<br />Firstly, let me say something about Durban II. The nations of the world have gathered in Geneva for a review of Durban I. This fiasco turned out to be an Israel-bashing week. Israel was the butt of continuous condemnation in that conference whilst the human rights abuses all over the world were overlooked. In China, in Saudi Arabia, in Iran, in Sudan, in Libya..just to mention a few countries. The worst nations involved in this condemnation were Sudan, Iran, Libya.. they took the floor. Durban II so dubbed, so nicknamed, remarkably began on Hitler's birthday, to be followed in two days by Lenin's birthday hardly gentlemen who observed human rights, and could hardly be called anything but racists. It was staged on the same day that Israel remembers the Holocaust. The Yom HaShoah, the Holocaust day they remember in Israel. They remember the 6-8 million who died at Nazi hands. It cannot be a coincidence, this extraordinary thing. Mahmoud Ahmadinijad was the only head of state to attend. That in itself should have been the warning. He was the main speaker. In the course of his speech, he did talk about human rights. He spoke about the oppressive nature of western powers and called for reform of the United Nations Security Council. But his main thrust was Zionism and Israel. He said, to quote him, &quot;Governments must be encouraged and supported in their fight at eradicating this barbaric racism.&quot; And he went on to say, &quot;Efforts must be made to put an end to Zionism&quot; and he also, just to quote another point he made, &quot;Israel was a most cruel and oppressive racist regime which was created from the pretext of Jewish suffering during World War II.&quot; Of course we know him as a Holocaust denier and he actually cut out of his speech the phrase, &quot;that he thought the Holocaust was dubious in extreme.&quot; In the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland and Italy refused to attend. When some 40 diplomats from more than 20 nations walked out as soon as Ahmadinijad began to speak against Israel, the Czech Republic withdrew also, altogether from the conference. The foreign minister of Norway however, stayed. It was amazing that with so many walking out, so many stayed and clapped, cheering Ahmadinijad. This is a list of the nations that walked out: <br />
<br />Austria, Belgium, Britain, Bulgaria, Cyprus and the Czech Republic left for good. Also Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Rumania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. The Swiss President met Mahmoud Ahmadinijad when he arrived which caused Israel to withdraw her ambassador from Switzerland in protest. <br />
<br />The Israeli foreign minister made a very sharp protest and not only over the Swiss involvement, but also over the Norwegian foreign minister. We are terribly disappointed in the attitude of Norway, not only in sending its high ranking representative to the conference as opposed to countries such as France and Britain, (they sent only lower down the scale representatives), but he was the only representative of a western country not to have left the room when the Iranian president started making his hate speech. This incomprehensible attitude is in serious contradiction with the mission that they think they are invested with in the Middle East. All this shows how bankrupt, morally and ethically much of the world has become, and the United Nations which supremely expresses that world. One wonders what was in the head of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, what was in his thinking when he convened Durban II? Did he really believe that it was going to get anywhere? One can only put it down to either naivety or stupidity. If the first Durban conference was a fiasco, this was a super fiasco. <br />
<br />There had been some good things about it the good nations that were there Britain, France and quite a number who remained, sought to ensure that the real questions of racism and human rights were covered. But it is nevertheless an extraordinary affair on Hitler's birthday and of the commemoration of the many millions of Jews who died in the Holocaust. There is no doubt about the growing anti-Semitism in Europe and North America and the United Kingdom evidenced in the growing number of anti-Semitic incidents. It does not augur well for the future. <br />
<br />Let me just say something more about this, particularly about the Church and the churches. This anti-Israel bias is becoming more and more pronounced in the so-called churches of most denominations. The Church of England, once so clear this year is actually the 200th anniversary of the Church's mission to the Jews is now with a minority of exceptions, almost completely anti-Israel. One has to go many, many miles to find a Church of England that is even sympathetic toward Israel. This can only lead to death and decay. Even amongst evangelicals there is the same disease. This may not surprise us, since divine judgment and hell are hardly today mentioned in evangelical circles. Evangelicals are today not necessarily evangelical. Once it was a question of believing the word of God and of proclaiming the word of God, not what we particularly like, and what is in fashion with our society today, but the whole council of God. There is an attitude of complex whereby the word of God is circumvented and contradicted: it is re-interpreted in the light of the 21st century and its fashion and philosophy. <br />
<br />This is what I want to underline: this reminds us of what happened with the churches in Germany and the rise of Nazism in the late 1920's and all through the 1930's. The Word of God is the Word of God and however contemporary we should be, it is a faith once for all delivered to us. To make the Word of God more acceptable to the 21st century, to re-invent certain principles, to bring them up to date with modern fashion is the beginning of deception and apostasy. We should listen to the survivors of the Holocaust such as Eli Wiesel, the Nobel prize winner and Tommy Lapid, who has recently died and Reuven Rivlin, the Deputy Prime Minister of our present government in Israel, they see the same hallmarks and evidence for the run up to the original Holocaust, in what is happening today in British and European society. I think that their warning is a very serious warning and has very real significance for all of us, if we will only heed it. The German churches, with some exceptions, one has to say, were totally taken with Hitler and with Nazism as part of a restoration of stability, financial stability, of national dignity and much else. Hitler gave full employment to the people. It took in the churches because they did not see the question of Israel. They believed that the Jews were the vermin of Europe as so often Hitler said, &quot;The bloodsuckers of European and British society,&quot; and needed to be dealt with. <br />
<br />A vibrant, living and faithful church is salt acting against decay and corruption. When the salt, as our Lord Jesus said, has lost its savor, it is of no use. It is light shining in the surrounding darkness and overcoming that darkness with God's light that is needed. When the light in the church has gone out, there is nothing. It is a human society, a cultural society, or a national society. <br />
<br />Let me say something about the world situation. Of course, I mentioned this in the last updates, but I will return to the matter. The worldwide recession is deepening. The International Monetary Fund, says that we have now a global recession which is rapidly deepening. The financial situation shows some ground for hope, but enormous sums of money, enough to bankrupt the nations involved, have been made available by governments and we should expect some alleviation of the problem. These stimuli should work in the short term. In the long term, they could be disastrous. I may be wrong, but I think not. The Lord God Almighty has become the Antagonist of the nations. Consider that amazing passage we read together in </font></font></em><em><font face="Georgia"><font size="3"><strong>Jeremiah 25 and I will read just verse 31: &quot;A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations.&quot; <br />
<br /></strong>I believe that if I am right, much worse problems are ahead in the climate and on the economic and financial level. I do not see this divine antagonism being placated. I can only see that this controversy that the Lord has with the nations will only deepen, with very severe consequences for the nations. It will not only be on the level of the economic and the financial and the climate, the physical condition of this planet, but on the social and political level as well. The root of this whole problem in my estimation is the division of the Promised Land. There is no way that you can take a divine covenant and tear it up, because it is not politically acceptable and introduce another pact, another alliance, another system, as it were, of living here in the Middle East. Every time they speak of the so called two-state solution, the judgment of the Lord will grow more severe. It is rather like the 10 plagues. Each time the Pharaoh hardened his heart, a worse plague followed. The United States and President Obama and his administration are wholly for the two states. Gordon Brown of Britain, his administration and Tony Blair are wholly for the two states. The European Union with its commission in Brussels is wholly for the two states. I am only mentioning these big blocks, these big nations, or these big blocks of nations&#65533;I could mention Russia and a number of other powerful countries as well, who have the same view. What it means is that the United States is on a growing collision course with the Almighty. It is the same with the United Kingdom and the European Union. <br />
<br />There are many things that I could say in this matter, but I can only point out what I see. The Lord is leading these nations to make terrible mistakes in human wisdom, whilst at the same time touching the planet physically. This touching of the planet by the Lord will end with his touching the sun, the moon, the stars, the tides of the sea and the oxygen that we breathe. It is very interesting in the words of the Lord Jesus as recorded in </font></font></em><em><font face="Georgia"><font size="3"><strong>Luke 21:25-28: <br />
<br />&quot;And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows; men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh.&quot; <br />
<br /></strong>It is interesting to note in this connection what Rahm Emanuel, the aide of President Obama and Israeli-born American has recently stated that in four years, there will be a sovereign Palestinian State. May the Lord God have mercy upon them. It is no small thing for the Lord God Almighty to be an enemy, to be an antagonist. For the Lord to be at war with the nations, especially the industrialized west, is no small matter and will have the gravest of consequences. Out of this turmoil and confusion will arise, in my estimation, the anti-Christ, the man of sin, as he is called, the lawless one. History teaches us apart from the word of God, that out of the periods of great turmoil and confusion, dictators have arisen. The anti-Christ will be in this instance again in my estimation an affable, likeable personality. He will have a brilliant mind which will produce great new systems of living and of thought, and an ability to unify and dramatically influence world society. In the end, he will appear. Is it now? <br />
<br />It is very interesting, I might add before I leave this matter of the world situation, it's noteworthy that the United Kingdom is currently investigating the weapons or their component parts which have been, or are being sold to Israel. Since 1973, however, Israel has cut down on British weapons and parts drastically. It stands today at only 1% of Israel's purchases of weapons. Nevertheless, the very fact the Foreign Minister, David Milburn who by the way is Jewish has ordered an investigation into this matter is, I think, very interesting. It shows that British society is slowly but surely becoming anti-Israel, which is one short step from anti-Semitism, anti-Jewishness. <br />
<br />Also I should say that the Member of Parliament, Clare Short, is arranging a video link with the houses of parliament, in which Masha'al the leader of Hamas in Damascus will be able to speak with British Parliamentarians. It is a ridiculous venture, since Hamas believes only in Jihad with Israel and her total annihilation. It doesn't say something for Clare Short's intelligence. She may be a fine lady in her own right and a persuasive speaker, but in this matter she has not done her homework. She is only to really study what Hamas's constitution says, to recognize that there is no &quot;wiggle room,&quot; no area in which they can truly negotiate a peace settlement. Would Britain sign a peace settlement with another powerful or even small nation, for that matter, that has as its constitution, the destruction of British Society and of Britishness? I cannot believe it. It is unbelievable to me, that a Member of Parliament is trying, by the back door to bring some kind of contact with Hamas. <br />
<br />There has also been another group of British Parliamentarians that have been visiting Hizbullah and trying somehow to get them in . I don't know what has gone wrong with Britain. It's the most extraordinary thing. We thought we had got rid of this disease that was in Neville Chamberlin, when he sought to appease all these people and to bring about peace. Now we have exactly the same thing now in this situation. May the Lord help us! That is all I can say in this matter. <br />
<br />Recently, I have received a number of prophetic utterances warning of coming war. The most noteworthy is from David Wilkerson. I think we should take careful note of these words, but not lose our balance and poise or go overboard on the matter. The strength and influence of Islam is everywhere apparent, even in the BBC and CNN and even Sky News, just to quote a few. At present Fox keeps absolutely clear of it. The growing power of Muslim communities in Europe, in Scandinavia and in the United Kingdom is something to observe. I have recently been to Leicester and I can hardly believe that that great city has a mosque on nearly every corner and that the prayer call is heard over the city. I find it unbelievable that it is the same in Bradford, it is the same in Birmingham to quote just three great cities in Britain. I wonder whether the British are really aware of what is happening in them. They are anti-Israel and incredibly pro-Islamic. There is no doubt that many Muslims just want peace and a livelihood, a home to live in, safely and securely, but buried within those communities is militant Islam. It is a Trojan horse in the Scandinavian countries&nbsp; Denmark, Sweden and Norway. It is a Trojan Horse in the Netherlands, it is a Trojan horse in Germany and it is a Trojan horse in the United Kingdom. It could well be that all of this will end in a war in years to come. <br />
<br />Now let me say something about the Israel election. A swing to the right is evidenced in the recent Israeli election. I should say something about the Israeli system, because it will explain a certain amount of what has happened. The Israeli system of proportional representation is the most democratic system in the world, but it is an unbelievably complex one and in many ways, unworkable. It results in weeks, if not months of horse trading, allowing very small parties an unbelievable power and clout out of all proportion to their size and the seats that they have. Israeli governments are therefore coalition governments. Very often those governments can be, by the nature of this system, unstable. The biggest surprise in this Israeli election was the amount of seats that Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel is Our Home) party, won, with Avigdor Lieberman as their leader. This won a big percentage and has become the third largest party in the Knesset. The first was Kadima, which interestingly although won more seats than Likud only, was unable to form a government because of this big swing to the right. The second of course was Likud with Bibi Netanyahu its leader, and the third was Yisrael Beiteinu. Bibi Netanyahu was asked by the President to form the Government. This coalition means that Bibi Netanyahu is our new Prime Minister and Labour decided last minute to join, we have Ehud Barak continuing as Defense Minister, and the biggest surprise, Avigdor Lieberman is the Foreign Minister. It is the largest cabinet in Israel's 61 years of modern history. Most political analysts and experts do not give this government much hope. They believe that there are inherent weaknesses which will bring it down and bring about a new election. This has occurred at a point in Israel's history when she is facing enormous challenges. What is the effect and consequences of this election? <br />
<br />Avigdor Lieberman's good showing in the polls and his becoming Foreign Minister has caused an enormous electric shock to the world at large, and particularly the Western world. For them it has become unbelievable and untenable that Avigdor Lieberman should be Foreign Minister of Israel, especially at this point when they are trying to push the two-state solution. Avigdor Lieberman has been given a very unfair showing by the media, and Israel's left wing. He is a Russian immigrant with a bullish character and ability for straight talk. For example in the Knesset he said that since President Mubarak has not come to Israel yet, he can go to hell. It wasn't exactly diplomatic language. When he became Foreign Minister almost immediately he said, &quot;16 years of discussion and concessions to the Palestinians have not bought us one iota of peace and anything else.&quot; I quote the Jerusalem Post: &quot;Lieberman's office issued a statement after the meeting with George Mitchell, the special envoy of the United States, that he had reviewed the diplomatic processes since the 1993 Oslo Accords stressing that the traditional approach had so far brought neither results nor solutions. Lieberman said that six former Prime Ministers had been prepared to make far reaching concessions but that the policies of the old Livni government in this regard had resulted in the second Lebanon war and the operation Cast Lead which was the war in Gaza. Furthermore,&quot; he said, &quot;Qatar and Mauritania had cut off ties with Israel, IDF soldier Gilad Shalit continued to sit in captivity and the diplomatic process had reached a dead end. The Foreign Minister said, the Israeli Government now had to formulate new ideas and a new approach.&quot; <br />
<br />I must say the result of all this is the statement that the Government is reviewing the whole of the last years and will produce a new plan. It believes that the Annapolis conference has failed. It is refreshing to hear straight talk coming from the Foreign Ministry. Avigdor Lieberman's position as Foreign Minister will undoubtedly cause problems. The Arab league is very angry. Egypt has said they will never receive him although Omar Suleiman, their man in charge of security, has already come here to Jerusalem and met him and asked him to come to Egypt. <br />
<br />Let me say something about the Middle East situation in particular. A quite extraordinary change is taking place in the Middle East. What it portends is at present, not too clear, but it could have tremendous significance for the future. A cold war is developing between on the one hand, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and on the other hand, Iran, Qatar, Syria, Hizbullah and Hamas. Already behind the scenes, a number of feelers are being put out on this matter, and it is very interesting to see what will happen. There is no doubt that although Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, and Jordan have to say certain things publically, secretly and unofficially, they are hoping that Israel will deal with Iran. They all see the determination of Iran to pursue its nuclear policy as the greatest single danger in the Middle East; greater than Israel. Now that is saying something. For nearly 60 years these countries, the Arab league, and all of them, have adamantly stated that Israel is the real problem in the Middle East. Now, into this equation steps Iran. Iran is a Shiite nation basically a Shiite nation; Syria is lead by Shiites well, really they are Alawites which are bonded to Shiites. Hizbullah is a Shiite community in Lebanon where it draws all its strength from. Hamas is not, which is an interesting point, but its attitude and its belief is very much the same politically as well as religiously, as the Shiite. This now means that Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan see the nuclear policy of Iran as a real threat to them because of the religious side of it. The Shiites have many scores to settle with the Sunnis. This interesting development which has been taking place quietly for the last year or more is becoming more and more clear. It is very interesting to consider what it might portend for the future. It is hard to believe that Egypt would ever throw her lot in with Israel or that the Hashemite Kingdom would (although they have been much more toward Israel than Egypt) and Saudi Arabia would find it very hard indeed. But the oil sheikdoms, other than Qatar, all the oil sheikdoms feel threatened by Iran and most of them have a Shiite community within their population. So there is a very real change taking place in this whole field of the Middle East. It is interesting to just to wonder what this could be. We should pray about this matter. Israel has been saved as a nation a thousand times by the division and factionalism of the Arab world. They just cannot stay too long together and so Israel has been saved again and again by this. Pray that the Lord will watch over this whole thing and fulfill His own purpose through it all. <br />
<br />The second thing is the war in Gaza came to its end a few months ago, without a goal being reached. It is true that by and large, rockets have not fallen on the south in the last month and that in itself is a success for the IDF, but the general anger of the whole world, the misrepresentation of Israel over the war in Gaza and the use of what the world calls &quot;disproportionate force,&quot; has brought some very bad ill consequences in the world at large. I personally believe that since Israel went so far, she might as well have gone the whole way and cut the monster's head off once and for all. That would have provided something. However, today or yesterday, Hillary Clinton speaking before one of the subcommittees of the Congress, being questioned about her foreign policy has said that if Hamas and Fatah are to be united, reconciled, she believes that the Americans cannot support that kind of government. I find this very interesting because basically there is really no difference between Fatah and Hamas. I mean, the fact of the matter is quite simple. Fatah believes in the annihilation and destruction of Israel, but long term, whereas Hamas believes that it has to take place immediately and that is the only real difference between them. Recently Mohammad Dahlan, (a Fatah politician) actually said it: &quot;There is no difference between Fatah and Hamas, we both believe in the same goal.&quot; Even Mahmoud Abbas said, &quot;We agree on this, that the end is the disappearance of Israel.&quot; The moral decay of the West , is seen in the work&#65533;if the foreign offices did their work properly, they could easily see as anyone with very little intelligence could see &#65533; Fatah believes in Israel's destruction, the PLO believes in Israel's destruction, but they are prepared to start with a small state, and stage by stage demoralize Israel until she disappears, whereas Hamas believes it has to be immediately. So Hamas is now called a terrorist organization, whilst Fatah and the PLO are called &quot;moderates.&quot; Basically, the war in Gaza brought this whole thing to a head and Fatah and Hamas has been unable to reconcile themselves to each other in spite of Egyptian help. It's an extraordinary thing, really, that is taking place. <br />
<br />President Obama visited Turkey and said some very nice words about Islam and Turkey. We still don't really know where he stands. He had a kind of Passover at the White House for the first time in the history of the White House, and kept it for two days. However, there were a whole lot of features about that Passover that were not exact, but nevertheless a Passover was celebrated within the White House, this year, for the first time in history. We just don't really know where Obama stands. He seems to be something for everybody. He has many faces, the many facets to his face. He is affable, he is likeable, he is very laidback in the sense that he is gregarious, open, friendly, and behaves in a way that we have not seen presidents behave before, except possibly Kennedy. It is very interesting to watch this new president. <br />
<br />It is interesting if I may say a few things now finally, for prayer it is a very interesting thing that we have for three years suffered drought conditions in Israel. This year, the former rains basically failed. I am not surprised with a President indicted for rape, a finance minister for corruption and fraudulence and a Prime Minister not yet actually indicted but being investigated for a whole number of corruptable offences. It does not surprise me at all that the Almighty has withheld the rain, but the interesting thing is that the moment that Bibi Netanyahu was appointed, and began to form his government, the former rains came and we have had, according to the Meteorological Institute for Israel, the normal and right amount of rain for February. This is extraordinary, it seems as if the Lord at least is showing some signs of happiness over Israel and that leads me to say that the word of God is very clear in this matter. It says that he that keepeth Israel, he that guardeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. Thank God that someone is guarding Israel --that is keeping Israel. We have had a government that has not bothered at all about really guarding Israel. <br />
<br />We have had two wars that have not been successful in their conclusion which gives cause for concern but there is someone who guards Israel and who has brought us through to this time. It is perhaps one of the things that we should remember: that the goal of all our prayer is the salvation and redemption of the House of Israel. The Lord's faithfulness in this matter is tremendous. It is summed up in that wonderful word in Hebrew: &quot;chesed.&quot; That wonderful word that encompasses a whole number of facets to its meaning is simply wonderful: loyal, persevering, overcoming faith. The Lord said to <strong>Jeremiah (chapter 31), I have loved you with an everlasting love, therefore with &quot;chesed&quot; this wonderful word with mercy, with loving kindness, with persistent overcoming love, I have drawn you</strong>. The recreation of the state of Israel is the result of that being drawn of that &quot;chesed&quot;. And you get this wonderful word again in Romans 11, buried in the New Testament in the great exposition of the gospel by the apostle Paul you have these words, &quot;as touching the election, predestination, will and council of God&nbsp; they (that is the Jewish people) are beloved (ARE, not were) for the patriarch's sake, for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. One of the aspects of that calling was to be a sign to the nations and Israel has always been a sign to the Nations. Once when a Chancellor asked Frederick the Great, &quot;What do you know of a single absolute sign of not only the faithfulness of God's word, trustworthiness of God's word, but evidence that God exists? Friederick said&nbsp; &quot;Yes the Jews.&quot; The survival of the Jewish people through these thousands of years of persecution, alienation, divorce and hatred, exile from the Land, is quite remarkable and the re-gathering of this people is extraordinary and again the prophet Jeremiah said, &quot;The Lord who scattered them will keep them as a shepherd does a flock.&quot; He's kept this nation through nine wars in sixty years. This is extraordinary and we can only praise the Lord. <br />
<br />So what can we say about this confrontation that is bound to come between the nations who believe in a two-state solution and our present government? If it holds fast as at present, I think there is going to be fireworks. I think of the word in </font></font></em><font face="Georgia"><font size="3"><em><strong>Isaiah 8: 9-10: <br />
<br />&quot;Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces. Take counsel together and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.&quot; <br />

One has to say that in spite of being hardened in part, blinded and laid on one side, this people are still a sign to the nations. Those that devalue this nation, that make it nothing, curse it, will themselves be cursed. Those who bless it will be blessed. It is exactly the same with the Church. The Lord's faithfulness to the true Church is a real faithfulness, a genuine faithfulness. He will not give up those whom He has redeemed and saved. All of this is part of the last times. It is interesting that when the writer of the Hebrew talks about everything being shaken to pieces, he says, &quot;Wherefore receiving a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace whereby we may offer unto God, service well pleasing to him, for our God is a consuming fire.&quot; That means that though there is a consuming fire, we have a Kingdom that is unshakeable in the midst of it all. The flames cannot reach it, they cannot touch it; it will come through exactly as it is. There is great comfort, it seems to me, in this as we look this whole world with all its problems. I believe that the Lord is behind all of this and we should not be depressed or demoralized by the events that are taking place. It is possible that this will end in a war, either in a war in the Middle East or a much greater conflagration, God forbid, that really covers much of the world. But the fact of the matter is that the Lord has a controversy with the nations. Its root is the division of the Promised Land and whilst that is pursued by the nations, by great powers or by nations whoever they are or ideologies, God has become their enemy. He will undo them, he will cause them to make mistakes, he will in the end, completely destroy them all. <br />

<em>Here this word, it is not today as comfortable to many ears as it used to be. People don't believe in judgment anymore, or hell anymore. They seem to think that God has retired; he is a nice old gentleman that lives in the sky and you can pull wool over his eyes, but God is the Everlasting Rock, He is the same, yesterday, today and forever. There is no way you can pull the wool over his eyes and no way you can contradict his word and get away with it. There is no way you can forsake biblical principles and still be the same. May the Lord give you all the ability and the power to pray as you have never prayed before, for the Church, that she be purified and that she be given a vision of the understanding of the times in which we live, and pray for this little nation buried in the Middle East in this great Islamic area, that the Lord will fulfill His word and keep her and make her a sign to the nations. </em></font></font></span></p>
