	<h2>Prophetic word for Great Britain Saturday 6 August</h2>
	<p class="itemTitle">Saturday 6 August 2011</p>
	<p>Hear the voice of the Lord, O Isles that I have so greatly loved and favoured. I
	the Lord the Almighty, I took you when you were nothing, clothed with skins
	and woad, and through My saving power, I made you great. When you were
	nothing, through My Word and your faith in Me, I lifted you and made you
	<strong>Great</strong> Britain. Through many awakenings and many revivals, stage by stage, I
	took you until you became a great power with the greatest Empire in the
	history of the nations. From you My Gospel and My Word went throughout
	the world, and tens of thousands came into an experience of saving faith!
	That Empire with all its many failings and weaknesses was still one of the
	most just and righteous Empires of history.</p>
	<p>Those Isles of yours were soaked with the blood of My faithful martyrs and
	its soil received the burnt ashes of those who would not renounce My Name,
	My Truth, and My Word. I, the Lord have not forgotten those who gave their
	all for Me!</p>
	<p>But now the whole nation that I created and sustained has turned from Me.
	They paganise their land, state and institutions; there is no voice heard to
	warn the nation. False religion, the work of world rulers of darkness, cover
	your Isles; A Laodicean church, neither hot nor cold, rumbles on like
	machinery. It is a church where I am outside of its routine; its organisation
	and its methodology. It is Christianity without Me: Religion without Me!</p>

	<p>My being is seared with pain, for judgement is determined against your land.
	I can do no other. I will destroy the vestiges of her greatness; I will return her
	to her first estate. I will wreck her economy, destabilise her in every way. I
	will change her climate, even her weather. I will prove to her that the way of
	the transgressor is hard and terrible. I will allow demonic forces held in
	check erstwhile by My Word and Gospel, and the living faith of so many, to
	become rampant in her social life, to the destruction of her society.</p>
	<p>Will you who know Me and love Me go blind and dumb and deaf into this
	judgement?</p>
	<p>It is time for you who love Me, who are faithful to Me, to take action! Stand
	before Me and plead The Finished Work of My Son. At least cry out to Me,
	that there will be those who turn from darkness, from sin, and be saved. For
	whosoever shall call upon My Name in the midst of these judgements, I will
	save!</p>
	<p>It will cost you everything to stand in the gap, but you will enter into My
	heart, and know deep fellowship with Me. Such travail conceived in your
	heart by My Spirit will cost your deeply, but it will end in My Throne and
	Glory.
