For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; against thee do they make a covenant: The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre: Assyria also is joined with them; they have helped the children of Lot. Do thou unto them as unto Midian, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon; who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna; who said, Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God. O my God, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind. As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire, so pursue them with thy tempest, And terrify them with thy storm. Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek thy name, O LORD. Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; yea, let them be confounded and perish; that they may know that thou alone, whose name is the LORD, Art the Most High over all the earth</em></strong>.&#8221; <br />
<br />An amazing Psalm</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span></font></font></font><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><font color="#000000"><font size="3">written at least some 3,000 years ago, and has the most incredible relevance for our present national situation. Every one of these names that is contained in this Psalm is to do with our present neighbours and surrounding nations who hate us. <br />
<br />Then I would like to turn to Ezekiel 35:

I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end; therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee. Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth. And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword. I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there: therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee. And thou shalt know that I, the LORD, have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour. And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it.

<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">In this Update, I cannot possibly cover all that has happened in the last three months. There</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> i</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">s so much that has happened, and much that I could try to cram into this, but this particular Update is extremely serious and grave, as I have already said. I want to concentrate on these matters: Firstly, I will talk about the last great attempt of Islam to take the world. Secondly, I will talk about the secret pact between Turkey and Iran, and the consequences for the Middle East, and for Israel in particular. I will then thirdly talk about Iran</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">s nuclear ambition, and fourthly, I will say something about the spiritual outlook. Firstly, the last and final attempt of Islam to take the world. The agenda of Islam, from the beginning, in the 7th century, of this era, has always been the same</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">. I</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">t is that it will finally subjugate the whole world, and dominate every single nation. Islam means submission. A Muslim is someone who is submitted. There are, of course, and I have to say it, many moderate Muslims</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">I know them. I have friends that are Muslim</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">they are wonderful, decent, peace-loving people. There</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">s no doubt that there are many moderate Muslims. But the fact remains that buried within the whole, is militant Islam, and once the militants begin to show themselves, the moderates disappear into the woodwork. Sometimes people say to me, Oh, but you know, I had a neighbor</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">they</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> a</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">re Muslim, but do you know that they believe that Jesus is coming back? Yes, they do</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">they believe that Jesus was born sinless, that He was born of a virgin, that He was the Messiah, that He had a Messianic ministry, that He performed miracles, but He did not die on the cross</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">He only swooned. He was, therefore, never raised from the dead, and He IS coming back</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">after Mohammad. The fact of the matter is, you had the whole gospel, and the heart of it is torn out. There is no atoning death of the Lord Jesus</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span></font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">therefore, no forgiveness of sins, and secondly, there is no new birth, because Jesus has not been raised from the dead.<br />
<br />One has to say, for many people who do not know much about Islam, it is incredible the expansion and increase of Islam in the world. One in every five people is a Muslim. By 2020, there will be one in four</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">that is, one quarter of the whole world</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">s population will be Muslim. We are now, in my estimation in the third and final attempt of Islam to take the whole world. It began with the 9/11 attack. That was the opening shot of this third and last attempt, spearheaded by Al Qaida, and of course backed by the Taliban, and many other militant Muslims through the world. The first attempt</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">I have mentioned this before, in previous Updates</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">was the Battle of Tours, in 732 of this era. Charles Martel, the grandfather of Charlemagne, was the man that put spirit and morale into the forces of Christendom. They weren</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">t born-again believers, but many of them</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">they were not Jews, they were not Muslims</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span></font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">and they actually were untrained, very badly prepared for the battle with the Muslim forces. The Muslim forces were far better disciplined, better trained and better armed. But the Battle of Tours went for the forces of Christendom, and the extraordinary thing was that Islam was routed, turned back into Spain and Portugal, and remained for 200 years in the Iberian Peninsula, before finally forced out of that Peninsula, into North Africa, where it stagnated for many hundreds of years. The second attempt, the Battle of Vienna, was as late as 1693 of this era, and once again, a young man, Jan [John] III Sobieski, of the royal family, in the Polish way of electing their kings, somehow he put spirit and morale into the forces of Christendom, and everybody expected that they would be defeated, and that the Ottomans would take the whole world. If they had won, in the first attempt, then of course, the Vatican would have been destroyed, there would have been no Reformation with Martin Luther, they would have crossed over the channel into Britain, and taken the British Isles, and probably the Pilgrim fathers would have been Shia Muslims fleeing from Sunni Muslims, which would have meant that the North America would have been colonized by Muslims. It is an amazing fact of history to look at it all in this light.<br />
<br />The same thing was in 1693, when it looked as if, even in Austria</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">almost the heart of Christendom</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">the battle would go for the forces of Islam. It didn</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">t. Instead, amazingly, the Muslims</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">the Islamic forces, were routed and fled so fast, that they left all their booty, and all their other things they had gathered in their great march across Europe</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">they left it, and fled on horseback, back into Turkey. It had left an impact that even to this day, is still there, in Bulgaria, in Hungary, in Greece, in all these countries that were subjugated by them. Only by the grace of God did these two attempts fail.
<o:p></o:p></span></font></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">We are now</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">in my estimation</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">in the third attempt. It began, as I have said, with the 9/11 attack, upon New York. You need to note one of two things that characterize this third attempt at taking the world. First, the discovery of oil, and from it, the enormous wealth that has been produced. That is an enormous characteristic of modern Islam</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">oil, and the enormous wealth it has produced. Secondly, the enormous influence through investment. The oil sheikhs, Saudi Arabia, have invested in stock exchanges, have invested in all kinds of things</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">they have even invested in football clubs unbelievably</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">but it is a fact. The footballers wear their shirts for their airlines, and all kinds of things. It</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">s a most extraordinary thing. You take London</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">Harrods is in the hands of Muslims</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">and a whole number of other great old British firms are in the hands of Muslims. The wealth that has been invested--then take the cultural and academic world. They have endowed universities, like the University of Exeter</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">the price was to build a mosque within the campus. They</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">ve done the same with a number of other universities, that were, financially, in very great stress. The Muslims have come in, the oil sheikhs have come in or Saudi Arabia, they</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">ve invested, but there</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s a price attached to it. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s really so interesting to see what has happened in this third attempt. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><font face=""><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">s not so much a war, as money and human reproduction. When you take, for instance, what is happening in Europe</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">enormous immigration of Muslims into Europe? It is estimated that anywhere between 35 and 70 million Muslims are now resident in European nations</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'">a large number of them having citizenship in those nations. If they have an average family of ten, within a matter of 20 years, the whole face of Europe will change. This is one of the biggest threats.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has not come through warfare or violence, it has just come, through it seems, natural means. Friends of mine in Birmingham, say that there are fellows are walking round with buttons on their lapel or on their sports [jackets] that say &#8220;2032.&#8221; If anyone asks, &#8220;what is this button you have</span></font><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">?<span>&nbsp; </span>W</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">hat&#8217;s 2032?&#8221; &#8220;This,&#8221; they will tell you, &#8220;is the year we will have a greater number of people than the ethnic population.&#8221; This is Birmingham. You take any of the cities, you take Karachi, you take Leicester, and you take all these other cities that have been overwhelmed, basically, by this. Now I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">m talking about Britain, because that I know better. I could speak about some others-- Germany, about Holland, the Netherlands, I could speak about Belgium, I could speak about France</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">where one in five people in Paris is a Muslim, I could talk about the Scandinavian countries, where there is a real chance of the loss of Swedish and Norwegian national culture. It is an amazing thing that we are witnessing. If Turkey joins the European Union, as David Cameron says when he was in Turkey, that he would throw his weight behind their being accepted, into the European Union as full members, then we will have another 70 million Muslims, plus more, added to the number already in Europe. All this adds up, it makes you realize that there is something more. Why I am talking about this matter is because, really, you needs to get a bird</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">s</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">-eye view that it</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s a world problem</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">it not just across the Middle East; it</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s not just Israel. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s something else. What is the thing that</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s behind the very real, anti-Israel feeling that exists in many European countries and in many of the Western countries of the world? Why? It</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3">&#8217;</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">s very much due to the money, and the investment, and the number of Muslims. We are not saying, of course, that every Muslim family is evil, and militant, and out to kill Christians and Jews, but what we are saying is that the moderates and good, peace-loving people retire into the woodwork, once the militants become evident, and powerful.<br />
<br />Then again, the terrorist acts, such as 9/11, are all part of this third attempt. We all know about them</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">we know about 9/11--the 3,000 innocent people who died, as the result of the planes that were taken over, and everyone in them died. We know that we had the same problem in Madrid, in the bombing of the railways, or in London</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">the bombing of the buses and the Tube, so we understand; we have a violence also connected with this, spearheading this attempt.<br />
<br />Then another thing I have to say about this whole matter</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">this third attempt is the incredible</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">I have to underline it</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">.....</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the <strong><u>incredible</u></strong> blindness and gullibility of Western leaders. Anyone who dares to say something about this is immediately dubbed a racist. Someone who is against</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">someone who hasn&#8216;t got a loving, turning the other cheek</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">that is, Christianity. But the fact of the matter</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">Enoch Powell said decades ago, in the Houses of Parliament, speaking against the possible immigration of a whole number of people</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">from Pakistan, from India, from the West Indies, he said, &#8220;If this goes through, this law, then within decades, blood will be spilled on the cities and towns of Britain.&#8221; He lived up to his name, Enoch. He prophesied. The fact is, he was shouted down, he was called a racist, a right-wing Fascist, and I don</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3">&#8217;</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">t know what else. He was none of the kind.<br />
<br />Now we have the same thing with Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. He has stood up, to speak against Islam, and what is happening in the Netherlands. He was even denied entrance into Britain, the United Kingdom, as a result. Well, I find it incredible that our leaders are so blind as to what is taking place. They try to make a difference between Al Qaida, the Taliban and militant Islam, and the rest of the Islamic world, as if the rest of the Islamic world only just wants peace, and an ability to earn an income, safely, and justice in the country that they live. The fact of the matter is very simple. We have, in fact, a deliberate attempt and strategy to take the world for Islam. It is hard for Western leaders to believe that religion, or theology could have any part in modern life. For them it is all past</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">something antique, something that belonged to the Middle Ages, or the Dark Ages. You don</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t get influenced by theology any more, not in the policies of a government, or the way of living for a nation. But the fact of the matter is that Islam lives by its theology and is committed to its theology. And you may have people who are not very bothered by it; nevertheless, when the final thing comes, is a good Muslim. So the fact that we are now facing is colossal. I hope I have managed to get this very difficult subject over.

<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">I want to say something about the Ayatollah Khomeini</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s words. He was the arch-leader and inspirer of the Islamic Revolution</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the Iranian Islamic Revolution. Over years, he defined a strategy which is now officially adopted by Iran, and most militant Muslims. To take the world, and especially the United States, he said again and again, Israel is the stepping stone. He asked the question, why did Allah allow Israel to be re-created? And he answered it by this. He said: Because of the lukewarmness of the Islamic masses. When Israel is re-created, it will energize them, it will pull them out, like a magnet, and they will become shahids (suicide bombers). They will be prepared to become martyrs for the cause. They will be devoted to Allah and to the Quran. Then Allah will give them the victory. They will liberate Jerusalem, liquidate the Israeli people, annihilate the Jews worldwide, and go on to conquer the United States and the world. He called Israel, again and again</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">his favourite term for Israel was not Zionist entity, but the &#8220;Little Satan.&#8221; And his term for the United States was the &#8220;Great Satan.&#8221; His strategy was, there</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s no way that you will beat the Great Satan, until first, you have beaten the Little Satan. Israel, he said, must be defeated, Jerusalem must be liberated, Israel is annihilated, Jews worldwide liquidated, and then the world will be ready to be taken over. Israel thus becomes, in the understanding of the Ayatollah (Ayatollah means oracle of God), that</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s why he was so revered--in the words of Ayatollah Khomeini, the stepping stone to world domination</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">this strategy, defined by Ayatollah Khomeini, is the official policy of Iran, and maybe Turkey</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">now, with the new fundamentalist attitude in Turkey growing apace. This is a serious thing, because</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">let me put it this way</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">this is not just Israel. It</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000"><font size="3">&#8217;<font face="">s not a threat just to Israel, or to the Middle East, it is a threat to the whole world, and they are blind to it. The Church is </font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face=""><strong><em>absolutely</em></strong> asleep. <br />
<br />There is one other thing I want to say in connection with this third attempt of Islam to take the world. Has Ezekiel 38 and 39</font> </font></font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the prophecies contained in those two chapters</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">anything to do with all of this? All the nations, mentioned in Ezekiel 38, 39, are at present, on the world stage of the 21st century. Cush <span>&nbsp;</span>Sudan, Put <span>&nbsp;</span>Libya, Persia <span>&nbsp;</span>Iran, and Meshech, Tubal, Roshall places in northern Turkey. This is beyond our understanding of the uttermost parts of the north</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">it has to be Russia. It can mean nobody else. If you take Jerusalem and go straight north, you come to the Black Turkey. Then you go further northward, you come to the Black Sea. Go further north, and you come to Kiev, and further northward, you come to Moscow, and then further northward, to Murmansk. It could n</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">o</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t be more clear</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span></font></font><span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="">in these two prophecies</font> </font></font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">that this great power in the north, the uttermost parts of the north cannot be Turkey. It has to be Russia. But Turkey is represented by Meshech and Tubal, and Rosh.<br />
<br />So we have a most amazing thing</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">and I remember when I wrote the little book, Battle for Israel, based on the Yom Kippur War, and the experience we had within it, I said, &#8220;If this prophecy has anything to do with the time of the end, something has to happen with Iran&#8221;. From being a great sympathizer with Israel, a close colleague of Israel</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the Shah, by the way, supplied Israel with oil every week of the Yom Kippur War</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">without fail. And I said in that book, something will have to happen that will turn Iran into a violent enemy of Israel. It has happened. Then I also said...is it possible that something will happen with Turkey that has a relationship with Israel</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">? V</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">ery much more</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">a working relationship with the IAF cooperating with the Turkey Air Force, our navy</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the Israel Navy, with the Turkish Naval Force, and with our army and their army. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s amazing what has happened over the years. The closeness of this thing. It has to change. We are in the process of watching it.
<o:p></o:p></font></span></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">What does all this mean? I only ask this question. I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">m not saying that Ezekiel 38 and 39 is about to be fulfilled right now, but what I am saying is this</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">: </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">I am not dogmatically asserting it, but I am asking the question, has it something to do with it? I remember in 1973, that the rabbis issued a statement that Israel is now in the run-up to the prophecies of Ezekiel 38 and 39. At that time, there was a lot of excitement about those prophecies, which has died down a bit, but I wonder whether it has something</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">very much</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">to say about the situation that we are entering.<br />
<br />Now I come to the second matter that I said I would deal with, and that is the secret pact ratified between Turkey and Iran. This was not officially announced. It has never been expressed in so many words; it was a signed pact between Turkey and Iran, under the auspices of the President of Syria, Bashir Assad. The flotilla was the first example of this new understanding. The pact is very simple: Iran will accept Turkey as the leader, head and pioneer of all Sunni affairs in the Middle East. And Turkey will accept Iran as the leader, the head and the pioneer of all Shia affairs in the Middle East. Now that extends all the way to Pakistan, to Afghanistan, right across, again to the countries that are neighbours to Israel. It is serious</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">immensely grave</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">humanly speaking, an alliance between the two most powerful Muslim states in the Middle East. I have to say, you need to take real account of this, because it will have very much influence and consequence in the days that lie ahead. An alliance, between these two, as I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">ve just said most powerful Muslim states in the Middle East will have very grave and serious consequences for the Middle East. The objective is to create a new Caliphate. I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">m not sure that most of the Western leaders have any idea</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">because once again, the Caliphate is something theological</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">to do with Islamic life and the whole outlook of Islam</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">on salvation, and having a right relationship with Allah. The objective is to create a new Caliphate, like the old one, under the Ottomans that lasted 400 years. This again, in itself could have very, very serious consequences. If these two powerful Muslim states do not fall out, but continue to cooperate in joint strategies, they will have Israel like a nut in a nutcracker. Only God will be able to deliver us. The flotilla, and more to follow, is not so serious as the alliance, and possible joint strategy of these two non-Arab nations. This is a most, as I have said, serious development in the Middle East, and may have very grave consequences. Pray.<br />
<br />The third thing I want to mention is Iran</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s nuclear ambitions. There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever, about Iran</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s nuclear strategy. She is pursuing it whilst the nations dither</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">whilst they talk about those sanctions, and this, that and the other, she is just quietly going on, with Russian help in her pursuit of a nuclear device. They intend to fulfill the Ayatollah Khomeini</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s strategy. Why do you think Iran is so interested in a nuclear bomb, or nuclear bombs? Why is she so interested in the missiles, and rockets that could carry nuclear warheads? For the simple fact that the Ayatollah Khomeini said that Israel is the stepping stone to world domination. They believe that they have to remove Israel from the world map</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">wipe it off the world map, knock it down, as they call it...as Ahmadinejad has said....like a &#8220;rotten tree.&#8221; They have to do that, in order that the overall, supreme objective, which is world domination, be fulfilled.<br />
<br />So, if you have followed what I have said, about this third attempt of Islam to take the world, Iran is absolutely faithful to Khomeini&#8217;s strategy, following it step by step</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">whether the nations scream and shout or whatever</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font face=""><font color="#000000"><font size="3">put sanctions on them, they just quietly go on. <br />
<br />That brings me to talk a little bit about the spiritual outlook. What a wonderful word that is in Psalm 121. He beholds (always underline these &#8220;beholds.&#8221; <span>&nbsp;</span>The Lord is drawing attention to something)
<o:p></o:p></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><font color="#000000"><font size="3">&#8220;<strong><em>Behold, He that keepeth Israel, neither slumbers nor sleeps.&#8221;
<o:p></o:p></em></strong></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><span>&nbsp;</span>He doesn</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t doze off</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">He does n</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">o</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t sort of fall into a little sleep</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">and not notice what is happening. He neither slumbers nor falls into a deep sleep. That has to be of immense comfort to Israel, and to those who know the Lord and trust Him in Israel. The Psalmist says, in that incredible psalm:
<o:p></o:p></font></span></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;<strong><em>I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains; from whence shall my help come</em></strong>?&#8221;
<o:p></o:p></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">In the ancient days, Jerusalem had to watch carefully, to see if the help came</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">always, generally through the mountains. So they were waiting for the first sign of the relief...</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">armies, or whatever, coming to the help of Jerusalem. But the Psalmist says;
<o:p></o:p></font></span></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span>&nbsp;</span>&#8220;<strong><em>from whence shall my help come? My help cometh from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth</em></strong>.&#8221;
<o:p></o:p></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">In other words, the help of Israel, again and again, is Divine. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s only when the Lord steps in that Israel is delivered. And we are in precisely that kind of situation now. We need something to happen</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">I have no doubt about the Lord</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s anger, or His fury over the division of His Land, over the contradiction of the covenant that He made with Abraham and with the forefathers. I have no doubt about it at all</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">I have no doubt about the judgments that will fall upon the United States, in particular, and the United Kingdom, and the European Union, Russia, for the goal that they are pursuing. The fact is that God</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s counsel is immutable. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s a wonderful word. It cannot be transmuted, it cannot be changed, it cannot be recast, or reinvented, or reinterpreted. When He made a covenant, the conditions of that covenant remained. That&#8217;s why He called it &#8220;an everlasting covenant&#8221; throughout their generations</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">whilst there is a generation of the seed of Abraham, physically</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the physical seed of Abraham, through Isaac, not Ishmael, through Jacob, not Esau</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">on the face of this earth, this covenant, 4,000 years old, is relevant, operative, functional. And that means that the only help that can deliver us is Divine. It is the help of the Lord God</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the Almighty. That has to be of immense comfort to us. Did you notice in the passages that I read</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">that incredible 83rd Psalm, speaking about these nations that have come together, they take counsel together, they devise a strategy</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">what is it for? It is to destroy Israel</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">that her name may be no more in remembrance. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s absolutely like a newspaper heading</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">...</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">I mean, it</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s so relevant</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">so absolutely and exactly precise, as to what is happening in the world at present. I find it immensely interesting, because if you look right through that psalm, the Lord says He will do all this that they may seek Thy name. So it is not just to destroy the Muslim, or Islamic nations, but that they might come to the Lord. It is a very interesting fact that there are more Muslims coming to the Lord, today, than at any single time, since the inception of Islam, in the 7th century. That is an amazing fact.<br />
<br />I wish some of those missionaries I knew when I was young, were still here on the earth, because they could count on their hands, those who found the Lord through their lifetime of ministry. But they all said the same thing, It will come. A huge harvest will come in the end, from Islam. But those that do not come, if you read on in that psalm, it says the Lord will destroy. I find that very interesting. Then did you notice Ezekiel 35? Did you notice what it says about Edom, about Mount Seir</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">that it wants to possess the habitations of God? That it wants to possess the mountains of Israel, and to say they are for our possession? That</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s exactly what is happening. Let</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s make no mistake about this. The fact of the matter is that they talk about a peace conference, but in the end, they want us dead. The only thing that will satisfy them is our demoralization, and our annihilation. It</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s no good</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">I mean people say, Oh, what a dark person</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">to have these ideas in his head</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">that these people</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">giving all this time</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">.</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""> I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">ve no doubt that George Mitchell is trying to do good; I</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3">&#8217;</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">ve no doubt that Hilary Clinton is trying to do good, but I have also no doubt about it, that the PLO executive wants us dead; that the Arab League wants us dead. The only thing that will ever satisfy them is when Israel is no more.<br />
<br />What does God say in Ezekiel? Again and again He says, HE will arise, HE will come to the deliverance of Israel. I find that very, very comforting, especially when you come to Ezekiel 36 and the Lord says there about the cities being rebuilt, and the towns being rebuilt, and man and beast being marvellously increased and multiplied</font></span><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">exactly what has happened.<br />
<br />It is amazing to me. We are reaching now a crescendo in this thing. The so-called issue of the settlements</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">the BBC always refers to it as occupied territory. Occupied by whom? A good point. I think that the Palestinians have occupied quite a bit of this country. The Israeli title deeds are found within the Bible, and we can only outline this. So I find it very interesting when people say, well, you know, isn</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t there a lot of sin in Israel...a lot of rejection of the Messiah, a lot of secularism, a lot of refusal to believe in God?</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><span>&nbsp;</span>Yes, there is, and interestingly, when the Lord said about the fulfillment of His immutable counsel, in Ezekiel 35 and 36, He says:
<o:p></o:p></font></span></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span><font face=""><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><em>&#8220;I<strong><span> did not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy Name&#8217;s sake</span></strong></em>.&#8221;
<o:p></o:p></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><span>&nbsp;</span>And twice he underlines this. In other words, the Lord is saying, I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">m not basing what I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">m doing in the defence of Israel, and the deliverance of Israel, upon how good Israel is. I</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3">&#8217;</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">m basing it on my holy name. In other words, God has a purpose; He has articulated it, made it clear, and is standing firm in the support of that purpose, and the fulfillment of it.<br />
<br />I find this all very interesting. I think that Israel</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> (</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">if I may say something in beginning to close) will be the breaking of Islam. You say, That</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s impossible! There are 30 Muslim nations in the world</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">at least, and some of them large and strong. Pakistan has the bomb; before long Iran will have the bomb. You are telling us that the Lord will break the back of Islam, on little Israel--seven and a half million people, in a postage-stamp of territory, surrounded by hundreds of millions of Muslims, and hundreds of millions of miles of Islamic country? Yes, I am saying it. The Lord will take little Israel and confound the Ayatollah Khomeini</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s strategy. They will come against us, they will probably come against us with even nuclear devices, chemical devices, biological devices, and the Lord will, in some incredible way, deliver Israel. I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">m not saying that Israel will not suffer. I</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">m just saying that He will deliver her. Why is that so? Because it</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s all something to do with the fulfillment of God</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3">&#8217;</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">s eternal purpose. That purpose of the Lord can never be fulfilled without the natural branches being grafted back into their own olive tree.<br />
<br />So as I see it, we have something here incredible. God will take little Israel, and use her to defeat Islam</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s third attempt at domination of the world. That will leave a vacuum which the anti-Christ will fill, and the last stage of God</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s purpose will be fulfilled in the coming of the Messiah. I don</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t have too much doubt about this, and I don</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t have any fear. Now I&#8217;ve lived in war all my life, so it doesn</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'">&#8217;</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">t really, in one sense, I suppose</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">but there are other people who have lived in war all their lives</font></span></font></font><span><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="">who are filled with fear. Listen, God is MUCH safer than the nuclear shelter. Why do you think the Bible speaks of God as a stronghold, as a fortress, as a shelter, as a cover from the storm, as a secret place, a hiding place? Why do you think the Lord speaks of Himself again and again as a high tower that the righteous run into and is safe? I mean, it is simply that the Lord is available for our protection, our security and our safety. We have nothing to fear. The most used term throughout Scripture is &#8220;fear not.&#8221; <br />
<br />I remember what I received, so many years ago, when I first became a believer. I came from a family that had no faith, as such, but I came to know the Lord, and an old, godly Sunday school teacher gave me a little booklet that I still have</font></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">Daily Light, and in it he wrote these words:
<o:p></o:p></font></span></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><font color="#000000"><font size="3">&#8220;<strong><em>Fear not, for it is the Lord who is with you. He will not forget you, He will not forsake you. Fear not, be not dismayed</em></strong>.&#8221; (Deuteronomy 31:8)
<o:p></o:p></font></font></font></span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><span>&nbsp;</span>That has lived with me all through the years in the ups and the downs.</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face=""><span>&nbsp;</span>It is the Lord who is with us. We need to discover the safety we have in the Lord, and the security we have in the Lord. We have no reason for fear, but it</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> i</span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">s a very human thing to have fear</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font face="">and that</font></span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'sans-serif'"> i</span></font></font><span style="font-family: 'Georgia', 'serif'"><font color="#000000"><font face=""><font size="3">s why again and again, the Lord says, Fear not.<br />
<br />So, may the Lord bless you. Remember the old injunction in the psalm:
<o:p></o:p></font></font></font></span></p>
