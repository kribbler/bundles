by Lance Lambert<br />
Jerusalem, Israel
<p>This is Lance Lambert speaking and this is my June, 2007 update. I want to read some of the scriptures. First of all, the second Psalm: <em>&#8220;Why do the heathen rage, and the people meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his Messiah, saying, Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will tell of the decree: the LORD said unto me, Thou [art] my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations of the Gentiles for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.&#8221;</em> </p>
<p>And, I want to add to that one of the most quoted messianic Psalms in the New Testament &#8211; Psalm 110, verse 1: <em>&#8220;The Lord says unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The Lord will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion, rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of Thy power, in the beauty of holiness.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And I would like you to turn in the new covenant to the last book of the Bible, Revelation 11:15: <em>&#8220;And the seventh angel sounded and there followed great voices in heaven and they said, &#8216;The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Messiah and He shall reign forever and ever.&#8217;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Again, I would like to turn you back into the Old Covenant to the prophet Haggai, chapter 2, verse 6: <em>&#8220;For thus saith the Lord of Hosts, 'Yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and I will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come. And I will fill this house with glory,' saith the Lord of Hosts. 'The silver is mine and the gold is mine,' saith the Lord of Hosts, 'the latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former,' saith the Lord of Hosts, 'and in this place will I give peace,' saith the Lord of Hosts.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And finally, back in the new covenant in the Hebrew letter, chapter 12 from verse 26: <em>&#8220;Whose voice (that is God's voice) then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying, 'Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only but also the heavens. And this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain. Wherefore, then receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>All these scriptures speak of turmoil, conflict, shaking and even war. And the whole conflict and turmoil is focused upon one phrase in Psalm 2 &#8211; God's king in Zion. <em>&#8220;Yet, I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.&#8221;</em> That's the focal point of all the controversy, all the confrontation, all the strife. It is over the purpose of God concerning the Messiah, the purpose of God for mankind.</p>
<p>And then again you have the same thing in Haggai, where the prophet speaks of a shaking of everything &#8211; of the seas, of the heavens, of the earth &#8211; and the shaking of all nations and then he says, <em>&#8220;And the desire of all nations shall come.&#8221;</em> In other words, the focal point of this shaking is the coming of what is called &#8220;the desire of all nations.&#8221; That is, that which all human beings really want and desire most deeply. It is, of course, a reference to the Messiah. We have no need to fear about these scriptures. It is not Satan who is shaking all things, but God Himself, with a positive and a glorious end in view. God has a purpose, an aim or goal in all of this. It is, again going back to Psalm 2, out of the nations a people born to be the inheritance of the Messiah.<em> &#8220;Ask of me and I will give you the nations, all the gentiles, for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.&#8221;</em> We know from the New Testament that this world lies in the evil one, we know that Satan is called the prince of this world but here the Father says to the Son, <em>&#8220;ask of me and I will give you the nations for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.&#8221;</em> This is the key to the conflict and the war &#8211; the aim or goal of the Lord in all of this shaking is to bring out a people for Himself from amongst the nations, for the uttermost parts of the universe to come back into the possession of God, to be the possession of the Messiah, and the salvation of the house of Israel.</p>
<p>We have this confirmed in the New Covenant in Romans 11:25: <em>&#8220;For I would not, brothers, have you ignorant of this mystery lest you be wise in your own conceits. The hardening, in part, has befallen Israel until the fullness, or the full number, of the gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be saved, even as it is written &#8211; there shall come out of Zion the deliverer, he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob and this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins. As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake, but as touching the election, they are loved for the patriarchs' sake for the gift and the calling of God are irrevocable.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Even the New Testament tells us that the focal point of all this conflict and controversy is the salvation of men and women, gentiles throughout the nations who will come into the salvation of God by the finished work of the Messiah. But to think that God is finished with the Jewish people is a terrible mistake, for he goes on to say, &#8220;and so all Israel shall be saved, even as it is written, there shall come the deliverer out of Zion and He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am entitling this update &#8220;THE WORLD IN CRISIS&#8221;. It may seem that I am overstating the present turmoil but we shall see this shaking of God leading to this crisis. The Lord will make the nations, whoever and whatever, how large or small, face the truth. Those who desire the truth will come to it and those who love darkness and the lie will progress more and more fully into the lie and darkness. There will be no neutral ground. It is very interesting that in the prophecy of Joel, quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, he says, <em>&#8220;speaking about signs in sun and moon and stars, and pillars of smoke and fire on the earth,&#8221; </em>and then he says, <em>&#8220;and whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&#8221;</em> In other words, right to the very end, in the midst of judgment, turmoil and conflict, there will be those who will come to the Lord, a harvest to be reaped.</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:9, we read these words: <em>&#8220;Even he (speaking of the antichrist) whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceit of unrighteousness, for them that perish because &not;they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved. And for this cause, God sends them a working of error that they should believe a lie that they all might be judged who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In this shaking, God is removing those things that can be shaken; that those things which cannot be shaken may become manifest. And He speaks in these wonderful words of receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken. In my estimation therefore, the present turmoil will lead to the final confrontation between God and Satan, even if it takes decades. Human history is but the expression of invisible spiritual powers. Daniel speaks of the Prince of Persia, the Prince of Greece, the Prince of Israel &#8211; this is not a fairy story. It is not something that belongs to the culture of the time in which Daniel lived. There are principalities of Greece, and principalities of Persia, and principalities of Israel. The archangel Michael is the prince of the Jewish people according to the Word of God.</p>
<p>It is very interesting, because this means there is a principality behind all the European Union, there is a principality behind the United Kingdom, there is a principality in the United States. Flesh and blood history, physical history we might say, is actually only the expression of spiritual forces. Powers that you cannot see with these eyes or touch with these hands of ours, but which are the real factor in this world.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul actually says, <em>&#8220;we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against hosts of wicked spirits in the heavenly places.&#8221;</em> That, again, is not a fairy story&#8230; he is not just drawing on some idea that was current in his day and time but in fact it is a window upon a whole world that lies beyond the visible and seen world that you and I are in. Out of these great spiritual battles and conflict and turmoil rise empires, superpowers, ideologies, nations. It is interesting to see that in Daniel 7:3 and 4, it speaks of the four winds blowing the sea into a colossal storm, it&#8217;s typhoon-driven seas. And out of those seas emerge four of the greatest empires the world has ever known: Babylon, Persia, Hellenic and Roman; and of course, it is also interesting to note that when you come to Revelation 13, the apostle John in the Isle of Patmos in a forced labor camp, sees the same thing. He sees the sea, which the sea always stands for the nations. In the Bible it's a symbol or a type of the nations. So out of this sea comes the last great beast, the last great empire. And this last great empire is all four of the previous ones of world history homogenized &#8211; it is one single beast that has the features of all of the four.</p>
<p>We are in a shaking that has not got its origins in Satan but in God. Satan may be part of it but it is God who is doing the shaking. The convulsions of the last century, the 20th century, in which we saw two world wars which completely changed the whole course of world society until our present day is a very good example of this shaking. A totally new concept of world society is arising. It is Babel all over again: Multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-faith. The only ones that are going to be the problem are committed, born again Christians, and dedicated, committed Jews.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment the extent of this turmoil that we are facing. The whole western world is in turmoil. The United States, for instance, which has been up to now stable, is a divided nation. The United Kingdom, which has been stable until recently, is a divided nation. Jesus Himself, said, <em>&#8220;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&#8221;</em> Out of such division in the nation, when it is so deep and so passionately held, comes confusion, error and failure. It is a recipe for disaster. I very much fear the coming American election. It seems to me it doesn't matter which candidate you have on which side, one side worse than the other, but I cannot see anything but a terrible shaking of the United States. Britain has already gone. Then you have the European Union &#8211; it has enormous plans for expansion, now 27 nations comprising some 460 million people. It's planning expansion into North Africa. The basis of this whole society is not Judeo-Christian nor biblical, but Hellenic and is multi-cultural, multi-faith, multi-ethnic. </p>
<p>Russia is in no better state. What we thought was a growing democracy doesn't look quite like the kind of democracy we thought might emerge; and we shall find, if we believe the Word of God, that Russia is going to be involved in some very big things in the last phase of world history.</p>
<p>And then we have the Middle East. There is no part of the Middle East that is not in turmoil. You go to the Far East, you have Afghanistan, you have Pakistan in which the president there is walking on a tight rope, you have Iran pursuing its nuclear program. When you go to the west, you have Turkey which has been until now pretty stable; but all of a sudden, Turkey is in turmoil. You have Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, so called; and you have Lebanon where there is fighting. Literally the pro-western government is fighting for its existence. Wherever you turn, the Islamic world is in foment and in the midst of all this, two huge new superpowers are slowly but surely developing &#8211; China and India. I don't fear India as much as China but these are destined to become very great powers in the last phase of world history. And Israel, in the midst of it all, an atmosphere of apprehension over Hezbollah in the north, over Syria &#8211; what is she going to do, is there going to be war or not &#8211; with Gaza and Hamas that cannot possibly change its constitution to negotiate any form of peace with Israel.</p>
<p>Now to all of this we have to, of course, add one other not inconsiderable factor &#8211; climate change. The whole media is talking endlessly about climate change and I think it's pretty well fact that something is taking place. Whether it is God who is doing it or whether man is at the root of it, the fact remains that something is happening in the climate as we are seeing the extremes in areas that we have never seen before. Jesus spoke about men's hearts failing for fear and for expectation of the things coming upon the face of the earth. He spoke of signs in the sun and the moon, and then men's hearts failing for fear, for expectation. We haven't got there yet, but nevertheless it is very interesting. What is it that is agitating the nations, the world and those spiritual principalities and powers behind our world if it is not the Lord Himself, His Word, His purpose, His kingdom, His Messiah. This is why I have always said that believers will never see the necessity of intercession and prevailing prayer unless the eyes of their hearts are open to the simple fact that the world we live in is essentially a spiritual world. In other words, it is what we do not see that has the real influence and effect upon this fallen world. And this, of course, is what is summed up in the words of the apostle Paul when he speaks to the church in Ephesus and says, <em>&#8220;We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against world rulers of this present darkness, against the hosts of wicked spirits in the heavenlies&#8221;</em>. Nobody is ever going to be involved in such warfare if they don't see that as reality, but once you see it as reality then it begins to mean something to us.</p>
<p>The final clash, it seems to me, between God and Satan, Christ and anti-Christ, light and darkness, is now within foreseeable distance; and the world in general, and the church in particular, is unaware and unprepared.</p>
<p>Let us look a little more closely at what I've been saying. The western world &#8211; what do I mean by the western world &#8211; I mean the most developed nations, whether it's Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, or whether it's the United States, Canada or the European Union or the United Kingdom, Russia &#8211; that's what I mean by the western world &#8211; it is in turmoil wherever you look. It is, at present, in the process of rejecting the Biblical heritage that it once had. Exactly what is said in that Psalm that we read &#8211; &quot;Why do the kings of the earth say, let us break their bonds asunder and cast away their cords from us&quot;. In other words, the Word of God, the Law of God, is bondage, it is a heaviness. It is a narrow-minded, unhealthy concept that we must throw away if we are going to progress.</p>
<p>These principles upon which nation after nation became great, they are now in the process of throwing away. Note carefully what the apostle says in the second Thessalonian letter, chapter 2, he says, <em>&#8220;They received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, and for this cause God sends them a working of error that they should believe a lie.&#8221;</em> I believe that the western world is now in the process of believing a lie. This is the epitaph of the United Kingdom, the European Union and possibly now, the United States. Their birthright is being exchanged for a mess of pottage. It is interesting that Pope John Paul II pleaded with the European Commission to at least mention the Bible and the Gospel as antecedents of European civilization; one of the sources, if not the source, they could at least mention it as one of the sources. They refused because they say that Hellenism is the real source of European civilization. Pope Benedict XVI also has sought to persuade the European Commission to add this into what they speak of as a source of European civilization but the European Commission has refused.</p>
<p>So all of this can be seen very clearly in the European Union, United Kingdom, and now there is a growing and powerful movement in the United States to bring her into the same condition. Witness, listen carefully to me, witness the extraordinary and dramatic warnings that the United States is receiving. In the last four or five years I have never remembered anything like the floods or fires or other things that have happened in the United States. Hurricanes, the worst ever, the floods, the worst ever, fires, the worst ever recorded&#8230; I always remember the words of Derek Prince, &quot;when God is speaking to a nation He begins very quietly and He allows certain things to happen and then He waits to see if there is any change, any waking up, any awareness. If they don't, it becomes worse. Then He waits until finally it becomes total.&quot; He always believed that was the process of divine judgment &#8211; beginning very gently and finally complete.</p>
<p>President Bush has fought courageously to defend Biblical principles. That is not so with Prime Minister Tony Blair. Both of them have shown remarkable powers of endurance to follow through with unpopular policies, particularly to do with the war in Iraq and the war on terror. Not at all like normal politicians because they must have been counseled that these are unpopular wars. Nevertheless, their roadmap policy, now listen &#8211; their roadmap policy, has led them onto a collision course with God.</p>
<p>When I was first saved there was a phrase we used to hear all the time in Christian circles: the Promised Land. Everyone spoke of the Promised Land. Now you never hear it today. It&#8217;s very interesting. It has dropped out of our vocabulary. Now it is the Holy Land or Palestine or Israel but you never hear the term the Promised Land. What did the term signify? Who promised it? God. It wasn't Moses or Abraham or one of the forefathers. It was God who promised this land, very clearly in a whole number of places, explicit, not just implicit, explicit in the Word of God. To whom was it promised? It was to the seed of Abraham through Isaac, not Ishmael and through Jacob, not Esau. It is a lie to say that it was promised to Ishmael and to Esau, the fathers of the Arab people. God made separate covenants with them which He has kept to this day. But the Promised Land was promised, covenanted, in a solemn covenant that God not only gave but confirmed on a number of occasions following. And what was promised? He is very clear that it is the land of Canaan. It actually gives the borders, the basic borders of this Promised Land in other places. But it is so clear this, in my estimation, this roadmap to peace for two sovereign states in this Promised Land, this division of the Promised Land into two separate sovereign states is, in my estimation, what lies at the root of their problems. It led them into disaster. I underline it &#8211; it has led them into disaster. You cannot contradict God, disesteem His covenants, pacts, or agreements and get away with it. The Almighty will strongly confront such, even if they are believers, and even if they've done many good things. Witness then, the singular lack of divine support for their policies. Both men have even been held up to ridicule in their own countries, let alone the rest of the world. I can sum it up in a word &#8211; everywhere you go in Europe, Bush is called the Texan Cowboy, as if the man is uneducated, unsophisticated, without education, it's incredible. Even Tony Blair, who is a kind of Disraeli figure actually in British politics, the longest serving Prime Minister ever in British history, he is held up now as a kind of icon of everything that is bad. Quite amazing. For the United States, this is ominous. The United Kingdom has virtually gone anyway. Already the judgments have gone to a board in these two countries, at one time champions of the gospel and of the Word of God. </p>
<p>There is today an overall lack of genuine statesmanship. We saw a glimpse of it in Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan; but the kind of statesmanship we saw in Winston Churchill and President de Gaulle, for instance, we do not see today. Men who are able to see into the future and men, for instance, who really had the courage to stick to what they saw. I know de Gaulle is not normally particularly thought of well in Anglo-Saxon countries; but you know, de Gaulle was remarkable. He actually said Britain's future lay with the Anglo-Saxon nations, not Europe; and I think that's a feeling that many of the British have within their hearts. He also said that Russia would have to choose as to whether she was Asiatic or European; and he said I believe she will choose she is European, and when she does, Marxism will be over. Exactly what has happened.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill, on the other hand, was quite amazing. I will quote him in a few moments in some of the things that he had said. There is a touch of this statesmanship in President Bush because he saw clearly that militant Islam was the biggest, largest single threat to European civilization. And we see it also in Tony Blair. They recognize the colossal danger which militant Islam represents. This danger cannot be underestimated. It has to be said that today there is a notable lack of leadership. Remember the true saying, &quot;A nation gets the leaders it deserves&quot;. Maybe Chancellor Angela Merkel will shine. Maybe President Sarkozy of France will shine. But we have to say the various western nations, with few exceptions, are like rudderless ships in a growing storm seeing only the present confusion and strife and blind to the real danger that awaits in the wings. It is a working of error that they might believe a lie, that all might be judged who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness. God is sending a working of error.</p>
<p>9/11 was the opening shot in a final war predicted in the Koran. The agenda, the Islamic agenda, is quite simple. According to the Jordanian journalist, Fouad Hussain, in a book that he wrote a while ago entitled &quot;al-Zarqawi&quot;, (this is the al-Zarqawi that was killed by the American forces in Iraq and was the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq) he entitled it &quot;al-Zarqawi, Al-Qaeda's Second Generation&quot;, the war which began with 9/11 has been divided into seven phases.</p>
<p>The first phase began with 9/11, which was intended to provoke the United States into a war with the Islamic world, which would then in turn awaken and challenge, provoke the Muslims worldwide. The second phase, Iraq would be the center of al-Qaeda's worldwide operation, exhausting the west, dividing their population and bringing a huge reaction to get out.</p>
<p>The third phase is from this year, 2007. This phase will be focused on Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas. In this period, Israel and Turkey will be assaulted.</p>
<p>The fourth phase: the bringing about of the collapse of western-orientated, Arab governments.</p>
<p>The fifth phase will be the declaration of the fifth Caliphate in Afghanistan. The Caliphate is essential to the fulfillment of the Koranic agenda, and according to the Koran, Allah&#8217;s purpose and strategy.</p>
<p>The sixth phase: total confrontation between the Islamic world and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The seventh phase: final and total victory of Islam predicted in the Koran, and the extermination of all Jews and Christians and all others who will not submit to Islam.</p>
<p>The possibility of such an Islamic victory is not as outrageous as it may seem. We must remember that at present, one out of every five in the world&#8217;s present population is Muslim. It is a sobering fact. There is within Islam an amazing revival, producing as we have been the witness, many suicide bombers and a devotion to Islam to the death on the part of young people. Would to God there were such a revival and renewal in Christianity with young people ready to be spiritually living sacrifices as it says in Romans 12:1: Ready to give up all right to themselves, take up their cross and follow the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Within the growing Islamic communities in western nations, there is an increasing demand to allow Sharia law in those local areas where there is a majority of Muslims. Even the appeal to allow Islamic government or parliaments alongside the national ones is evidence that a sea change is taking place in western nations. And due to the policy of multi-culturalism, multi-ethnic and multi-faith concepts, this is being accepted.</p>
<p>It is also, just as an aside, extraordinary the number of programs extolling Islam on, for example, the BBC World Service and CNN. Not few advertisements for Islamic funds and economic help programs are evidence of a huge surge of confidence and faith that the Islamic cause will win the world.</p>
<p>The large families which characterize Islam and the below replacement birthright of the western nations is frightening. For instance, I find it interesting &#8211; Caroline Glick is a columnist and a very respected one in the <em>Jerusalem Post</em> &#8211; recently she wrote this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some 12.5% of Swedes are immigrants and around half of Sweden&#8217;s immigrants are Muslims. Muslims will soon comprise the majority in many of Sweden&#8217;s cities. &#8220;</p>
<p>The intrepid Scandinavian blogger Fjordman recently penned an essay, &#8220;Jihad and the Collapse of the Swedish Model&#8221; in the online <em>Brussels Journa</em>l. In it he relates the significance of Sweden&#8217;s Integration Act of 1997 to Sweden&#8217;s national self-destruction. The Act officially proclaims Sweden a multi-cultural society. Notes to the Act stated, &#8220;Since a large group of people had their origins in another country, the Swedish population lacks a common history. The relationship to Sweden and the support given to the fundamental values of society thus carry greater significance for integration than a common historical origin.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Fiordman explains, &#8220;This Act was nothing less than national suicide. Native Swedes have been reduced to just another ethnic group in Sweden with no more claim to the country than the Kurds or the Somali&#8217;s who arrived there last Thursday. The political authorities of the country have erased their own people&#8217;s history and culture.&#8221; The authors of another book explain that the problem is that the ethnic group described as Swedes implicitly are considered to be nationalist and thereby are viewed as racists.</p>
<p>Baroness Caroline Cox, formerly one of the deputy speakers of the House of Lords in the Parliament in Britain, wrote this, also quoted in the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>:</p>
<p>&#8220;A recent public opinion poll indicated that 40% of Muslim youth in the United Kingdom wanting to live under Islamic law, that&#8217;s Sharia law, rather than British law, showed a growing state of malaise that threatened to destroy the country&#8217;s society and core values.&#8221; </p>
<p>Baroness Cox, who campaigned against government sponsored legislation backed by the Muslim Council of Britain that would have deemed it a criminal offense to criticize or joke about Islam or promote another religion, revealed that the British government had already made arrangements in certain communities to enact Islamic law on social matters, a move she called extraordinarily na&iuml;ve. She also said we have people in our midst who wish to use the freedoms of democracy to destroy our democracy and the very freedom it enshrines. She cited British intelligent figures that 100,000 British Muslims believe that the July 7, 2005 bombings in London were justified and that 1,600 identify with the bombers and were prepared to carry out such an attack again. It is amazing to believe that the western nations have allowed this kind of thing to come into their midst.</p>
<p>I said a few moments ago you cannot underestimate this danger. Listen to the words of Winston Churchill speaking in 1899. I am quoting this from a report in the <em>Christians for Israel</em> English newspaper:</p>
<p>&#8220;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries. Besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exists wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its race and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child or wife or concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout central Africa raising fearless warriors at every step, and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled&#8221; &#8211; now listen &#8211; &#8220;the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.&#8221; He was prophetic.</p>
<p>It is an understanding of this militant Islamic strategy that led President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair to confront it. If there has been a general misunderstanding of their perception it has been largely due to the fact that they never clearly articulated that perception for fear of a backlash from Muslim communities within their own national borders. Behind all of this movement, this revival and renewal in Islam worldwide are huge, powerful, spiritual principalities and powers. This is not flesh and blood; it is a spiritual world ruler of darkness. In my estimation, Islam has yet to reach its climax. Twice before, it sought to take the Christian world. In 732 AD in the Battle of Tour, near Paris, when the whole world thought that Islam would win, God used Charles Martel and thus, the Muslims were defeated or the whole of Europe would have been Muslim; and in 1683 AD in the Battle of Vienna, led by the Ottoman forces, the whole Christian world thought that the Muslims would win. They were much better trained and armed than the British forces. Jan Sobieski, the Pole, led the Christian forces, and by the grace of God, the Muslim forces were defeated. In both, it was the grace of God alone that they failed. Now Islam is poised for the final assault.</p>
<p>In much the same way in which the church in the 1930&#8217;s was asleep to Hitler and Nazism, backing Neville Chamberlain, believing that he was a great Christian statesman and a defender of Christian civilization, and holding Winston Churchill up to ridicule as a drunken warmonger, the church today is asleep to what is happening. Witness the manner in which even evangelicals are beginning to question the atonement, in particular, penal substitution, which I might add, lies at the heart of our salvation. I think of the words in Isaiah 53 and verse 10: &#8220;Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him to grief. When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hebrew word translated here in English, &#8216;bruise&#8217;, is actually a very quiet word. It could mean &#8216;crush&#8217;. It pleased the Lord to crush him or it pleased the Lord to shatter him. It&#8217;s exactly the same word as in verse 5: &#8220;but he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities.&#8221; He was crushed, shattered. </p>
<p>Many of the same evangelicals, for the most part, are anti-Israel, which is only the ancient hatred of anti-Semitism under a new guise. They hold a few warning voices such as David Virtue and Dr. Patrick Sookhdeo of the Barnabas Fund in derision. It has been my understanding from church history from which, as with all history, we never learn, that once Christian believers begin to belittle the Word of God, to devalue, displace, deride or ignore the person of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, or begin to question the full atonement in his finished work at Calvary, that becomes the beginning of apostasy. The history of the church is full of such evidence.</p>
<p>Today we have evangelicals that do not believe in hell, do not believe in divine judgment either now or in the future, who believe in conditional immortality, who do not believe in the trustworthiness of the Old Testament or even parts of the New Testament. What kind of gospel do these evangelicals preach? It is an emasculated gospel, a matter of the mind rather than of a revolution in the heart. I suspect that they preach a gospel which is much like a presidential election address. Decide for Jesus for he will make you happy and fulfill your ambition. There is no call to repentance or restitution, there is no declaration of coming judgment or a hell from which to turn, no conviction of sin as a result, and one must question whether there is a true genuine new birth. The rot has started; the end will be the collapse of the house.</p>
<p>I always remember Professor Einstein when he was asked about the law of relativity, which he defined, and what he really thought about it and the way it had been applied; and he said he never for a single moment thought that the law of relativity would be applied to morals and ethics. And he said, &#8220;If I had realized that, I would never have defined it.&#8221; I think that is exactly where we are. There is no such thing as absolutes anymore in modern Christianity. Everything is relative.</p>
<p>In all that I have said I do not wish for a moment to stop genuine intercession for the nations of the western world. There could still be tremendous awakenings in those countries, even when the judgments of God are bored in them, we should be positive, not negative. We need to pray with deep passion that God will have mercy upon our countries. A harvest can be reaped, even when the dark, black clouds of a coming storm are on the horizon.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can also pray that the Lord will revive and renew His church, if only in a faithful remnant. It is interesting to note Acts 2:21 in its immediate context of judgment, the final phase of this age. And Revelation 19:6,7 where in the midst of all this fearful judgment on Babylon, it speaks of the bride, &#8220;Hallelujah, the Lord God the Almighty reigns, let us rejoice and be exceeding glad for the bride hath made herself ready&#8221;. So in the midst of all this judgment, things happen. We should pray along these lines.</p>
<p>Let me say something about the Middle East and Islam. Of course, I&#8217;ve said a lot about Islam in a world context but just a little about the Middle East now. The whole Middle East is in a state of turmoil as I&#8217;ve said, from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran in the east to Turkey, the Lebanon, Hezbollah and Hamas in the west, and at it&#8217;s heart, Iraq, in a fearful and heartrending condition. Iran is progressing with determination and dedication to reach its nuclear status. No one in their right mind can doubt that Iran has a goal and that goal is the possession of a nuclear bomb. Nor, if we listen to what Ahmadinejad says can we have much doubt that he intends to use it on Israel. His latest words just a few days ago, &#8220;God willing in the near future we will witness the destruction of the corrupt occupier regime.&#8221; That&#8217;s us. Well, he&#8217;s got another thing coming because there is one who said, &#8220;He that keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The emergence of Iran as a nuclear power will dramatically change the status quo in the Middle East. The moderate Sunni Arab nations have nearly as much to fear as Israel does. Iran is at present in the process of emerging as a Middle East superpower. The only Islamic power to have a nuclear device is Pakistan and the growing turmoil and conflict there can only be of great concern to us. The one person who at present restrains the more radical and militant Muslim elements in Pakistan is President Musharraf. He walks on a tight rope. If he were to go, and radical elements were to take over, the outlook for the Middle East and for Israel would be somber indeed. The alliance of two nuclear Islamic states could even rock the whole world, especially if it&#8217;s radical, militant Islam that is in charge of those states.</p>
<p>For those who pray, it is interesting to note the amazing turmoil in these three countries. What spiritual forces are at work here? Al Qaeda is, of course, headquartered in Afghanistan and the Pakistan border. Shiite Iran believes that the mufti, the Muslim messiah will shortly appear in the midst of huge strife, bloodshed and war. Ahmadinejad believes he is the forerunner of the mufti and many of the ayatollahs recognize that fact. This mix of messianic destiny, religious devotion, and hatred of Israel and the west is a satanic brew and is bound to have dire consequences for the Middle East and the world.</p>
<p>Turmoil is seen also in both the Lebanon and Turkey. The battle is on for these two countries whether they are to be free or Islamized. The legitimate government of Lebanon has its back up against the wall. It is now fighting at this very present time in two areas, one in the north and one in the south, Palestinian camps in which have been embedded Al Qaeda forces.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that huge dark spiritual principalities are at work throughout the Middle East. The world ruler of darkness who energizes Islam has violently arisen in the Middle East with fearful results now and to come. Iraq is without doubt the evidence of this fact. Suicide bombers every day, not one but often double figures. Bodies of Muslim men found every day in the rivers, many of them who volunteered in the army or security forces and the police in order to keep extended families alive. One can only have sorrow for them. The Muslim violence, which began in Israel, has come home to roost in Islam itself. One can only feel great sorrow for these poor people.</p>
<p>Syria is the other factor. Through her client state of Iran, she has been the channel, the conduit for arms, money and training for both Hezbollah and Hamas apart from what she is receiving herself from them. Is Syria preparing for war with Israel? She is certainly rearming and has taken great strength and hope from the second Lebanon war in which Israel suffered not a little defeat. Syria believes that if she adopts the Hezbollah strategy she also could triumph over Israel. At present, the Syrian preparations are defensive but that could change in a moment of time. Iran has been pulling all the strings in Lebanon, in Hezbollah, in Syria and in Hamas. It is generally thought in Israel that the turmoil in Lebanon and in Gaza is Iran's doing with the aim of distracting the world from her nuclear program. </p>
<p>We should pray for Arab believers in the whole of the Middle East. It has been thrilling to hear of Muslims coming to the Lord all over the Islamic world. This has never before happened. Never before, at any time since the birth of Islam in AD 622, have such numbers of Muslims been coming to the Lord. It is quite extraordinary and marks at least one ray of divine light and hope.</p>
<p>We should pray for these people. I heard recently of pastors meeting together in Amman, Arab pastors, 100% for Israel, more so than some of our Messianic believers. I find that amazing. They will be meeting again in Turkey. I think this is something, to me, extraordinary. I think their courage, their faithfulness to the Word of God, to the Lord Himself, is something to be commended.</p>
<p>I am amazed that the murder and rape of Christian believers in Islamic lands, the torching of Christian places of worship, Christian publishing houses and Christian bookshops, is hardly, if ever, mentioned in the world media. The murder of three dear believers in Turkey recently got some mention but on the whole, there is an incredible silence. Reports from Bethlehem, which I believe to be accurate, speak of 27 nominal Christian girls raped, property of Christians being taken with no redress in courts, one Christian place 14 times torched, a pastor 3 times shot. In Jericho a Christian meeting place 3 times torched, all this without even mentioning Indonesia and Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>An unhappy and apprehensive nation has just celebrated its 59th year of independence, after 8 wars, and the 40th year of Jerusalem's reunification. The extraordinary storm that hit Jerusalem on May 16 on Jerusalem Day with cloud bursts and large hail so unusual in mid-May, caused many to wonder if God Himself was speaking to the nation. Certainly, it may presage a much more stormy immediate future for the whole status of Jerusalem. Zechariah the prophet spoke about this in Zechariah 12:1-3, and also in verse 9. It is interesting and significant to note, I think, that on the next day to Jerusalem Day, the 17th of May, Ascension Day was celebrated according to the church's calendar. And I think that's a marvelous reminder that whatever storm may be on the horizon for us over the status and future of Jerusalem, the King of Israel is enthroned at God's right hand. I think that's something that's worth remembering.</p>
<p>I said Israel is also in this kind of turmoil that is all over the world. There is a general feeling of apprehension concerning the immediate future: The violence in Gaza, the possibility of renewed war with Hezbollah, not to mention Syria. To this we add the growing threat from Iran, which is only a question of time before it becomes reality. And the unbelievably incompetent and inept government that Israel has at this present time: corruption in high places where the financial sector has shaken Israel's self-confidence. From the President to the Prime Minister to the Minister of Justice to the Finance Minister, the list of charges and the many rumors that have sprung from those charges has not made for a stable and respected government.</p>
<p>The determination of the present government hang-on to power is quite extraordinary, and reveals that the wheeler-dealer Prime Minster is at least a very accomplished politician.</p>
<p>Consider for a few moments the withdrawal from Gaza, which was supposed to bring peace to our southwest border, and of which Ehud Olmert was the prime architect and inspiration, has singularly failed. Since that withdrawal, over 2,000 rockets have been fired into southern Israel. From May the 15th to the 20th there have been 287 rockets and 2 more Israelis killed, with more rockets every day being added to the total. Originally, this Gaza withdrawal was to be the precursor of a large withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, the so-called West Bank. This has been dropped as impracticable by the present government. There has been some talk of a withdrawal from the Golan, which would be much more widely unpopular than any other withdrawal. This talk is based on noises about possible peace coming from Syria.</p>
<p>The Kadima-led coalition, in particular Ehud Olmert, has been desperately looking around for a means of regaining their popularity. At present, all polls show that if there was an election now, Likud would be voted back with Bibi Netanyahu as Prime Minister. The support for Olmert is between 2 &#8211; 3%. The joke at present, the current joke, is even his own mother would not vote for him. The best thing I can say is that we have a new chief of staff commanding the armies of Israel, Gabi Ashkenazi, who seems to have his head screwed on the right way.</p>
<p>I should also mention here that it was not only the Gaza withdrawal, which has so singularly failed, but also the Lebanon withdrawal under Ehud Barak has proved to be as real a failure. It should be remembered that it was Barak, when Prime Minster, who offered some 98% of Judea and Samaria, half of Jerusalem and the whole Temple Mount to Yassar Arafat, who mercifully refused the offer and began the intifada which caused so many lives, claimed so many lives, and mutilated so many more.</p>
<p>On September 17, 2006, the government of Israel appointed an official governmental commission of inquiry and examination of the second Lebanon war. A few weeks ago, this report was released to the public. The full report will only be released in August. The government seems to be somewhat afraid of it. This represents the findings of the commission for the first five days only. It does not matter which way you look at this report, it is utterly damning. In my estimation, it would have been normal in most countries, in the light of such findings, for the whole government to resign and to call new elections. Here are a few quotes from the Winograd Commission:</p>
<p>&#8220;We start with the decision of the government on the fateful evening of the 12th to authorize a sharp military response and end with the speech of the Prime Minister in the Knesset on July 17th. Despite this broad support, we determined there were very serious failings in these decisions and the way they were made. We imposed the primary responsibility for these failures on the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense and the outgoing Chief of Staff. Again the primary responsibility for these serious failings rest with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, and the outgoing Chief of Staff. We single out these three because it is likely that had any of them acted better, the decisions in the relevant period in the ways they were made, as well as the outcome of the war, would have been significantly better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, the Prime Minister bears supreme and comprehensive responsibility for the decisions of his government and the operations of the army. His responsibility for the failures in the initial decisions concerning the war stem from both his position and from his behavior as he initiated and led the decisions which were taken. The Prime Minister made up his mind hastily, despite the fact that no detailed military plan was submitted to him, and without asking for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, the Minister of Defense is the Minister responsible for overseeing the IDF and he is a senior member in the group of leaders in charge of political, military affairs. The Minister of Defense did not have knowledge or experience in military, political or governmental matters. He also did not have good knowledge of the basic principles of using military force to achieve political goals. Again, in all these ways the Minister of Defense failed in fulfilling his functions, therefore his serving as Minister of Defense during the war impaired Israel&#8217;s ability to respond well to its challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, &#8220;The ability of Hezbollah to sit on the border, its ability to dictate the moment of escalation and the growth of its military abilities and missile arsenal increased significantly as a result of Israel&#8217;s unilateral withdrawal in May, 2000,&#8221; (that was under Barak) &#8220;which was not followed as had been hoped by the Lebanese Army deploying on the border with Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, &#8220;The Israel Defense Forces were not ready for this war. Among the many reasons for this we can mention a few.&#8221; Listen carefully to this. &#8220;Some of the political and military elites in Israel have reached the conclusion that Israel is beyond the era of wars&#8221;. Isn&#8217;t that amazing. I will say it again, &#8220;the IDF was not ready for this war. Among the many reasons for this we can mention a few. Some of the political and military elites in Israel have reached the conclusion that Israel is beyond the era of wars. It had enough military might and superiority to deter others from declaring war against her. These would also be sufficient to send a painful reminder to anyone who seems to be undeterred since Israel did not intend to initiate a war. The conclusion was that the main challenges facing the land forces were below intensity asymmetrical conflicts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Given these assumptions, the IDF did not need to be prepared for real war. There was also no urgent need to update in a systematic and sophisticated way Israel&#8217;s overall security strategy and consider how to mobilize and combine all it&#8217;s resources and sources of strength &#8211; political, economic, social, military, spiritual, cultural and scientific &#8211; to address the totality of the challenge it faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems to me, with former Prime Minister Arik Sharon still alive but in a totally comatose condition, a present government all over the place and desperately, possibly irresponsibly, holding onto power at any cost, Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank in a violently belligerent condition, not only as regards Israel but amongst themselves, and the rumblings of a distant but powerful storm soon to break upon us, that the Lord is, to quote Hosea the prophet, &#8220;hedging up Israel&#8217;s ways with thorns and building a wall against her that she cannot find her path.&#8221;</p>
<p>All these things that have happened in the last few years are the judgment of the Lord upon Israel for her sin, her unbelief, her secularism, her contradiction of the Torah and her demeaning of the covenants God has made with her. At the root of our present problems lies this whole philosophy of what has been dubbed post-Zionism. The Winograd Commission&#8217;s point that I have read very carefully, about the political and military elite believing that Israel is beyond the era of war. Can you believe that? Anyone who reads their Bible &#8211; the Word of God is so central to Jewish life &#8211; can you believe anyone who reads their Bible believes that Israel is beyond the era of war? Especially with things like Iran, and I don&#8217;t know what else. It is beyond me, I can only call it blindness; there is no other word for it. It is the blindness of intelligentsia, as blind as Nazism in the 30&#8217;s until it was too late.</p>
<p>Moral decay, terrible lowering of ethical standards, corruption, selfishness, greed, the love of money surfacing, it is so contrary to the ideal of Zionism. That we should work with our own hands, that we should not depend on others, that we should even work at times not for money. I mean it is amazing to me. At least we know that He who keeps or guards Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. Thank God, someone is there who neither is drowsy nor asleep.</p>
<p>May He use all the present situations, the stormy future, the hatred and misrepresentation of Israel and this post-Zionist decay so evident in her present government and condition. Israel is in the wilderness so to speak. Quoting the prophet Hosea, again,<em> &#8220;If so, may the Lord speak comfortably to her&#8221;,</em> literally in Hebrew &#8211; <em>&#8220;speak to her heart&#8221;</em>. The Lord, the lover of Israel, will win. It will cost Israel much but He will win. It is worthy of note that both the name of Jacob and Israel are found together in Romans 11:26 &#8211; <em>&#8220;and so all Israel shall be saved, even as it is written &#8211; A deliverer shall come out of Zion and turn away ungodliness in Jacob.&#8221;</em> I find that amazing that these two names, Jacob and Israel, are found in the New Testament in one of the most amazing prophetic passages in the greatest exposition of the gospel in the New Testament. What is it a reference to? It is a reference to Jacob. When he finally saw himself, when he was finally sick of himself, when he was finally&#8230; he knew there was no where he could turn, behind him was Laban, in front of him was Esau, then he was ready for the heavenly visitor. That was when the Lord appeared and wrestled with Jacob, and it was then the Lord said to him &#8211; <em>&#8220;You shall no more be called Jacob but Israel.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I have a feeling that what happened to Jacob as recorded in Genesis 32, I think it is a prophetic enactment of something that is yet to come. In other words, what happened to Jacob was real, it happened, it was historic; but it was within itself a picture of what God is going to do with the Jewish people and with Israel in particular. The end is glorious. The desire of all nations will come. If that is the goal, the aim of this divine shaking of all things is worth enduring. We are receiving a kingdom that is as unshakeable as the King himself. Here we stand near to the completion of the purpose of God to call out of all the nations from the gentiles a people for Himself, to save the house of Israel and to produce a bride to reign with Him in the ages to come. God will not fail and the guarantee is the Messiah seated at His right hand.</p>
