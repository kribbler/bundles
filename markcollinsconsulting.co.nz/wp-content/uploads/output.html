    <body>        <h1> Freedom comes with Responsibility </h1>
        <p> <p><img class="alignright  wp-image-382" src="http://markcollinsnzltd.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/leader.png" alt="Motivation" width="363" height="215" /></p>
<p>Freedom exists through a delicate balance of you having the courage to live with the responsibility of thinking and acting as an individual.<br />
<strong><br />
Are you as free as you would like to be? </strong></p>
<p>Many people seem to trade freedom for security and the opportunity to shirk personal responsibility. Religions, companies, groups, communities can all be guilty of high-jacking your freedom.</p>
<p>Make a significant difference to how you feel this year, write down the areas of your life that you would like more FREEDOM. Do one thing a month towards taking more responsibility in those areas for the rest of the year. To help you stay accountable; tell someone you respect and ask him or her to hold you accountable by asking each month, what you have done?</p>

        <hr />        <h1> DIY Agreements </h1>
        <p> <p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-783" src="http://markcollinsnzltd.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/businessDIY.jpg" alt="businessDIY" width="300" height="197" />Business owners often need to write their own everyday agreements and it is critical for them to be clear and in easy to understand English.</p>
<p><strong>Two suggestions:</strong></p>
<ol style="color: #000;">
<li>State clearly what you agree to, what the intention is and what the result will be.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consider this clause, which can change everything: &#8220;Any disagreements over the interpretation of this agreement will be resolved through binding, informal arbitration. Both of us agree to hire a non-involved solicitor, submit up to five pages of material to state our case, and abide by his/her decision.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

        <hr />        <h1> Challenge your self over Christmas with three opposites! </h1>
        <p> <p>Growth only occurs when you do something different from what you previously would have done.</p>
<p>This is without a doubt the best time to challenge yourself to lift your expectations and open your mind.</p>
<p>Write down three things that you will be doing between Christmas and New Year that you are prepared to do exactly the opposite to what you normally would do. (this might be as un-threatening as being early for an event if you are notoriously late)   Of course then you need to follow through &#8211; don’t tell  anyone the reason why you have decided to behave differently.</p>
<p>Write down what you identified as a consequence of behaving differently as it will help you understand the power of becoming the success that you were supposed to be!!</p>
<p><strong>Best wishes for 2015 and thanks to all those that regularly read my blog and encourage me with your feed back</strong>.<br />
I will be taking a break over Christmas but I will send you something thought provoking again after the 21st of January.</p>

<p>The amazing gift of now, today, this year, that is so often misused.</p>
<p>Every day we are gifted amazing opportunities of time, health, friendships and many more things. We get to choose what we do with them, how we do it , what we think about them and how we feel about them. All of these things we have some control over and when you are managing all the things that you can influence and control to the absolute maximum of your ability right now, you will live an incredible life.</p>
<p><strong>So appreciate and do more with what you have got and you will be happier and more fulfilled.</strong></p>
<p>This applies to your work life too, regardless of if you own the business or just work in it your opportunity is to commit to making, selling or giving your best for today as you will never get today again and somehow the accumulative effect will be part of <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1791217041"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span>.</p>

        <p> <p>Stay humble it will serve you well. When you feel like you are overwhelmed, not making the progress you desire, feel you aren&#8217;t succeeding- create a list of &#8220;How lucky you are&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble getting started, look at the news (briefly- too much can be depressing) and consider the plight of war ravaged communities and countries, the future of kids that have lost their parents with Ebola, living through a natural disaster etc.</p>
<p><strong>Your lucky list can be kept to help remind you your problems are nearly always resolvable!</strong></p>

This last week one of my very successful and highly accomplished clients realised she had made a mistake and dropped the ball on an opportunity, she was mortified. When you have very high personal standards it is sometimes hard to see such mistakes positively, but it can be the catalyst to realising a system improvement is necessary.</p>

Consider each persons attitude on each of their three current projects or objectives, rate them on a positive/negative scale (10 being extremely positive 1 being totally negative). Whilst different opinions must be encouraged it is very apparent if a person isn&#8217;t part of the solution, they are part of the problem.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-686" src="http://markcollinsnzltd.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/takingrisks.png" alt="takingrisks" width="288" height="175" />Speed beats size in our current market place so make sure you use your opportunities. Every business needs people that have a little bit of entrepreneurial “can do”, so make sure you value and cultivate that spirit in your managers and team leaders. Encouraging a little bit of risk taking, within some careful controls of course, but this one thing can revitalize your culture and employee responsiveness, which will increase your customer experience! Identify at the beginning what the parameters are and if necessary have them moderate each other but also remember to recognise team efforts even if something fails.</p>

This problem can be addressed with surprising results just by reversing your approach and the questions you ask.</p>
<p>Rather than asking your people for an update on their results ask them to tell you three things they have done this week that has resulted in failure. After just two or three weeks your approach will have changed the focus of your team and at the same time have encouraged them to try new ways.</p>
<p>This may feel counter intuitive but it is only a stepping stone and after a few more weeks change your question again. Now ask them for, one failure and two successes. This simple small change will encourage people to have a go and learn that small failures are part of every success.</p>

<p>Whilst it is universally accepted that your performance will be substantially improved with a coach or a mentor, you shouldn&#8217;t stop thinking and acting on your own thoughts. I believe a good coach should provoke, motivate, empower, balance, compliment hold you accountable, bring new insights, broaden your thinking as well as create focus. You should hear the advice and ideas but not always listen after all it is your business and life!</p>

I took  about 2 months to excavate the previous wall and lay the footings and when  ready on the date predicted rang to say I was finished.</p>
<p>The aggregator had Firths deliver the blocks the very next day and the block  layer started the day after. It was only then that I found out the block layer  worked for himself and from that point I expected I would need to manage my expectations through him. But much to my surprise a couple of days later  I received a phone call from the aggregator who was ringing to check on my  satisfaction with the work thus far before he authorizing the blocks to be pumped fill of concrete and completion of stage one. He said he had been to  inspect the work and was extremely knowledgeable about the job and the quality  of workmanship. Highlighting that he had noticed a variation of alignment  where new met old due to the footpath not being straight. (I couldn’t see it even  when I looked) He said he would instruct the plasterer to straighten this by re- plastering the old wall out at no extra charge.</p>
<p>I felt I had just experienced exceptional service just because the guy actually  made sure he delivered on what he had agreed to and had delivered on his  standards not just accepted the standards of who was laying the blocks.</p>

In these spaces you will find waste of all sorts, redundant equipment, underserviced customers, underperforming staff. These are all easy opportunities to improve your business and your profit.</p>
<p><strong>Try this also when looking at time, particularly between diary appointments.</strong></p>

        <p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-481 size-full" src="http://markcollinsnzltd.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/measurement1.png" alt="measurement" width="685" height="325" /></p>
<p>Most businesses operate POS “point of sale”, transaction and customer management software that they bought essentially to collect important business data and measure how well the business is performing.</p>
<p>The collection of measurements and data is a worthless, waste of time and effort unless you use it to improve your approach, processes and the behavior of your staff.</p>
<p><strong>I suggest everyone adopts this 3 step approach:</strong></p>
<ol style="color: #000000; list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 45px;">
<li>Have at least 3 key goals (no more than 7 until you are very experienced)that will make a difference to your business.</li>
<li>Identify what measurements you can get from your operating systems to indicate your progress towards achieving your goals. This measurement should be taken at regular intervals daily, weekly or monthly and reviewed for change against the previous measurements</li>
<li>Adjust your effort and approach to develop a trend improvement towards your goal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Write down, what you know about your customers and customer groups,  needs, desires and wants.  Now ask your customer facing staff to add to the list. Validate the list. (if  you don&#8217;t know how ring me to discuss). The objective here is to identify the top twenty things that are important  to your customers and what you currently do to meet their expectation.</p>
<p>Identify one thing and improve it this week, next week pick another thing and so on, this is a continuous process. You will never stop doing this but you will become a lot more successful customers to purchase off.</p>

<p>In my experience we get the information we need at the time we need it, but often it is hidden amongst a pile of other, often contradictory advice. The key seems to be more about recognising good advice when it’s given. I suggest two things are seriously likely to improve your success in this regard: one is training your self to stay open to different ways of considering the situation or opportunity, the second being to develop and maintain a small trusted group of people whose opinion and advice you value.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> The power and rhythm of “your” beat </h1>
        <p> <p>You only need to listen to any piece of music or stand and watch the waves on a beach to realise the power and importance of rhythm.</p>
<p>You too have a rhythm and the more you are in sync with it the less stress you will feel. Watch for clues in others as to what their rhythm may be, fast tempo or slow and heavy. There are many words that may help you with this early awareness but two very good words to start with are: Weak and Powerful. When your rhythm is powerful you are closer to being in sync and can expect big things to happen.</p>

Convert all your business thinking and documents to measure and reward value and results.</p>
<p>In the food industry most contracts would still need to document when the work needs to take place IE between 8 am and 4.30 pm. Other than that, move the focus of all other thinking to the value delivered.</p>
<p>This needs to be part of the person’s job to be involved in measuring and commenting on their value delivery. IE a waiter needs to know how many customers he served and the average check value, a sales person may need to measure the average $value of their sales calls per day.</p>

<p>How far away are the mobile phone apps that will some how feed the mind and counter the Anorexic trigger of, “I am over weight”, or the over eating issue of  feeling good when eating. Is there an opportunity for someone to create a set of  psychology based apps to replace the chemical and drug related treatments like  the nicotine patch treatment for giving up cigarettes.</p>
<p>This would certainly fuel the change in the healthy eating lifestyle space and the ever changing the food industry.</p>

<p>As we see more and more public concern over food chain security the onus will fall on all successful companies to <b>prove</b> the reliable source of their ingredients.The latest evidence shows huge populous distrust in both USA and China of the safety of their respective countries food chain.</p>
<p>This will become an integral part of every company’s marketing story and will need to be verifiable and independently audited. This is a great opportunity for NZ primary and added value food exporters.</p>
<p>I recommend you integrate this thinking into your business plan now so it can become part of the way you think and an increased focus in your food safety plan.</p>

<p>In that moment I realized the benefit of setting goals is paid out incrementally during the journey to achieve them in the form of belief and purpose. John has incredible strength and courage and is an inspiration to all of us to work hard at being the best we can right up to clocking out.</p>
<p>I hope I can show the same commitment to my goals and courage as I enter the shadow of my life!!</p>

<p>A young man doesn’t meditate and feels there is something missing, maybe even a bit anxious.</p>
<p>As an old man he meditates every day and feels a sense of achievement, calm and complete.</p>
<p>How does he know whether it is meditation or age that is giving him the different feeling?</p>

<p>Last week I made a mistake with my “e”booking on a Jetstar flight, there was no loss to the airline as I booked my ticket departing on the 8<sup>th</sup> and returning on the 8<sup>th. </sup> I meant to depart on the 7<sup>th</sup> and return on the 8<sup>th</sup>. Their process for dealing with the situation was totally inept, I was treated like I was an inconvenience, no one had any discretion or authority to deviate from a company directive out of Australia, the specialist on the information and ticketing desk couldn’t work their computer system to issue a new ticket and $200 and 24 minutes later I was on my way to the flight feeling like I had been punished for having made the mistake to fly with Jetstar.</p>
<p>By contrast I had to buy a replacement printer that same week which I bought from Office Max. The customer service rep emailed me all my choices and I duly ordered it and it arrived the following day. A couple of days later I received a letter and a sticker typed up with all the purchase codes and names of the ink cartridges and consumables it used.  This meant I could stick it on the printer and when I need to order replacements it will be easier to find the right products. Thoughtful and adding value!</p>

        <hr />        <h1> Treat your suppliers with the same respect as your customers!  </h1>
        <p> <p>All our businesses are co dependant on our suppliers. When a supplier relationship is such that you both benefit it should make you more competitive (this doesn’t always mean cheaper) and both businesses should share in the success of increased business.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" style="border: 2px solid #fff;" alt="suppliers-customers" src="http://markcollinsnzltd.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/gg61818338.jpg" width="170" height="170" />Win-Win isn’t periodically and repeatedly driving down the purchase price, increasing rebates, demanding 60 and 90 day payment terms and continually imposing increased compliance costs.</p>
<p>A good test of how well you understand win/win is to identify what the actual cost or gain is to your supplier every time you change or request something. IE if you request a 30 day extension in payment terms and if over draft facilities are at 12% you are effectively adding 1% onto your suppliers costs. This cost drops straight to their bottom line so if they were making 5 % they are now making 4% which is 20% less. Obviously double sales volumes will more than neutralize this and deliver benefits for both of you.</p>
<p><strong>Work together and help each other!</strong></p>

        <p> <p><strong>The trick is measuring and reminding yourself regularly:</strong> Search the net for habit building Apps for your phone, some are free, but I use “Way of Life“ App which cost a little over $6 as a one off payment? It graphs your performance reminds you of your goal, requires no set up and is very convenient to tick the daily tasks when done.</p>
<p>Carry on with this routine until you manage to get 21 consecutive ticks in a row on anyone task, this is the accepted measure of having created a new habit.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-217" alt="$20Challenge" src="http://markcollinsnzltd.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/nz_money_20_dollar_notes_fanned_out_1234_N2.png" width="207" height="181" />If you are finding this too difficult establish a reward and or a penalty &#8211; Les Probert, a friend of mine taught me the $20 trick, it is genius. Make yourself accountable by giving your friend your monthly new habit targets and a $20 note. If when he/she checks in at the end of the month you can’t produce the app showing you have succeeded they cut up the $20 bill. (watching someone cutting up your money is very action invoking)</p>
<p>Use it yourself and teach your staff, great for your managers when introducing new daily procedures, exercise, measuring marketing etc.</p>

If I smile at them a few meters before we pass they nearly always smile back and say “good morning” or “hi”. If I don’t smile and just say hi about 40% will walk past with out any engagement at all.</p>
<p>This proves something I have known for many years and whilst important in all businesses, no where is it more important than in sales and customer service. <b>Improve your success by employing happy people that want to smile</b>. Train your existing staff on the value of a smile and insist on a genuine smile greeting every single customer. Lead by example and actively discourage people that don’t smile from staying in your employment!</p>

        <hr />        <h1> Comparing Food Service Options  </h1>
        <p> <p>Modern kitchens in all areas of NZ’s hospitality and food service have the same key drivers  albeit they support a variety of different service approaches. These are of course: food quality, deliverable on time and to be cost effective.</p>
<p>Many large establishments in the hospitality, healthcare sectors have adopted with some good success  a cook chill food service process whilst the remainder of the market predominantly use cook serve.</p>
<p>If your kitchens or your service delivery equipment need to be replaced you really should  review which food service system bests suit your needs now and for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>There can be a lot of things to consider in making the evaluation and specialist assistance  is recommended. In many ways there is more flexibility and better leverage of volume  using a cook chill meal solution but they do require a lot of discipline and focus on process  management than the traditional cook serve model.</p>
<p>It is also very important to be cognisant of the need to re-educate all staff of key changes that are rudimentary to the success of this changed food service approach. The alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cook Serve &#8211; The food is cooked fresh, held hot in bain-maries and or holding ovens. The food is then plated and served to the customer or alternatively transported to satellite servery points and then plated and served to the customer. The longer food is held warm the more it looses nutritional and presentational qualities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cook Chill &#8211; The food is cooked and quickly chilled to below 3C, held for up to 5 days  (Open Cook Chill) or 28 days in vacuumed, sealed pouches (Closed Cook Chill). The reheating process can be achieved as a bulk unit or as a plated meal. This means that   the meals can be prepared in advance and if necessary transported, prior to the quick reheat process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cook Freeze &#8211; The food is cooked as for cook chill and then snap frozen. This allows  for storage of up to 3 months between initial cooking and rethermalisation. If being considered as a large-scale food service solution it does seem to require massive  volumes to cover the significant setup cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have considerable experience in the use and evaluation of different food service systems and service equipment and can help identify opportunities and solutions in all areas of your evaluation and or implementation of any food service or kitchen change.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> “GLOBAL” management can kill local initiative. </h1>
        <p> <p>As more modern businesses become global, there seems to be an ever increasing   tendency to disregard the local style. There are many ways a task may be achieved and too often we see an over prescriptive approach dictated from an office in a city many   km’s away from where the action is. In many cases the prescribed approach may have   originated or be directed from a different country! How could we manage this better? A start may be to genuinely consider the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">Identify the reason and benefits to be gained from standardizing the processes?  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">What does the situation look like from a local perspective: client, staff and community?  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;"> What can be done to mitigate any negative consequences? </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ffffff;">What are the cultural and behavioral differences of people in the place of process  origin as compared to the place being pressed to change to conform and change? Size of population, regional spread and parochialism are significant factors  </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the company reason believable? “Global best practice” is often not what it says. Make sure the change delivers these gains or rethink the change. This is so easy to do, and so often not done. The result is a loss of individual ownership, commitment and  initiative by local managers and employees. This is passed on to the customer in the form of lack of can do, flexibility and customer focus, resulting in a loss of confidence and  belief by staff and customers alike.</p>

        <hr />        <h1> 10 important actions to managing out sourced service provider’s. </h1>
        <p> <p>Many services are out sourced these days from catering, pest control, laundry,   printing, mail services, accounting, payroll, marketing, maintenance, grounds, cleaning and the list goes on…. Just about all company’s and organizations have out sourced one or more of their support services . The consequence of out sourcing services ranges from it being;   very successful and efficient, to very frustrating, difficult and not cost effective. Organizations that have been successful out sourcing a service or services get: good quality, excellent customer service, effective service delivery, accountability and effective cost management.  Without exception they will have all done the following things well:</p>
<p>1. Scoped and documented the service being out sourced.<br />
2. Adopted a robust and thorough tender and selection process.<br />
3. Contracted the service provider to deliver on the promises in their   proposal.<br />
4. Included incentives and penalty clauses.<br />
5. Created flexibility so as the organisation’s service need changes so does   the contractor.<br />
6. Developed appropriate KPI’s.<br />
7. Demand transparency but allow a fair profit margin on good service.<br />
8. Measure the service provided with independent audits.<br />
9. Maintain good communications and reiterate the area of focus.<br />
10. Track performance throughout contract term and retender periodically.</p>
<p>These can be broken down into three groups &#8211; Before tendering, the tender process and then contractor management.</p>
